Her name was Anna. Pronunciation: Ah-nuh. Any other pronunciation was unacceptable, so you had better not try An-ah or any other nonsense like that. Anna worked as a secretary at a paperclip corporation, and she rode her bike to work because she read in  The Times  that it was good for your health. She had lived in New York City all her life, and lived in the most sensibly priced flat she could find. She was twenty-eight and a half years old and lived with two roommates, Marcie and Ivy, and exactly one dog. The dog was small, and properly trained, and it never wet the floor. Anna was just like everyone else, but she had a secret. She would be going somewhere under false pretenses tonight. Now, this may sound unlike Anna. I suppose I have presented her as a rather sensible person, someone who was not likely to engage in dubious affairs. However, to Anna, these actions were prudent indeed- though she was breaking a rule of society, it was for a very good reason. You see, Anna liked food. She liked it very much. But not being an extravagant person, who did not make a large salary at the paperclip company, she had devised a way to experience New Yorks finest delicacies- every single night. Anna opened a large, spiral-bound planner, in which she kept all important appointments and meetings. Every day, written at the bottom of the daily schedule, was a different mans name. No, Anna was not a serial killer. She had a different date, every night, with a different man, with a purpose: to receive one free dinner. The men, you see, had no idea in the slightest of Annas devious plan. Anna didnt have a lot of friends, but she had recently reached out to every person she knew in search of set-ups (but really food, of course). She scheduled eight dates, one after another, and was looking forward to a glorious eight days of free dinner, paid for by the unknowing men. They would think they were simply out for a nice date, happy to buy dinner for a pretty girl. In reality though, they would all be in the clutches of the evil Anna. They would never receive a call back after the date, and Anna would get away scot-free, with a full stomach and unchanged bank account. She smiled to herself. This plan was truly quite genius.  That night, Anna put on a dazzling dress and spritzed some perfume. She wanted to impress her date, so he would buy the entire menu for her. She took a cab to the restaurant- it would be rather unfashionable to ride her bike. During the ride, she recalled what she knew about her date. Her coworker, Ashley, had recommended him. She said that while he didnt have a lot of prospects, he was cute! She met him outside of a sparkling restaurant in the center of town. Stanley Penton, recently divorced and nearing forty, had a simple smile and an innocent demeanor. He looked like the kind of man who has nothing to hide.  Hopefully,  Anna thought,  that includes his pocketbook. She sat down to dinner across from him, feeling slightly overdressed to his shabby suit. That was the point, after all, in wearing such an extravagant outfit. It communicated to him that she was a woman worth spending money on. In the time she spent with him, Anna did not learn much about Stanley, perhaps because there was not much to learn. He was an uncomplicated sort of fellow, who seemed rather comfortable in his life, although obviously bothered by his recent divorce. He still wore his wedding ring, which struck her as strange. Perhaps he had many strange habits, which was all the more reason to dump him after this one date. Not much conversation ensued, as Anna was focused entirely on her dish: roasted mushrooms over oysters with a side of pickled pears. Several minutes later, she pushed her dish forward with a sigh. I am finished, are you finished? said Anna rather curtly. Well, yes, I suppose, Stanley said, surprised. Can I escort you home? I dont think so. she responded. Have a nice night, Stanley Penton. You might have felt bad, squeezing an expensive dinner out of this poor man. But not Anna. She was completely heartless, or at least, that was what she told herself. Its possible a twinge of guilt followed her home as she left Stanley behind to pay for his own cab. Not having a large amount of contacts in her phone, Anna had called an old college friend, who still lived by the university. Kensey Mackenzieson answered with a cheery, Anna!! How ARE you? Its been so long! Anna was unprepared for Kenseys energy. Look, Ill be straight and to the point. I need a date. Oh, like a date for a, like, wedding, or- Anna cut her off. No, just a date. Do you know of anyone? Well, theres not a ton of like, people here that are like, your age I mean theres a couple of guys that have been here like, forever or something! That will do, Anna said. How much do they typically make? Well, their dads are like, suuper rich, you know. Good. Thank you. Sure thing sister! Ill stop by the frat house and see who I can find. We gotta like, catch up sometime! Yes, forward me his number please once youve found one, and thank you. And so, Night Two of the Genius Plan was formed.  Landon and Anna found themselves at an upscale restaurant off of campus. Her date was 27, and had thinning hair and the body of a man who enjoys quite a lot of beer on weeknights. He was dressed in baggy shorts, a tank top, and sandals with socks. Landon ordered a large plate of wings off of the bar menu, while Anna knew she would enjoy the expensive lobster. So, you friends with Kensey? Landon said. Yes, we went to college together, Anna responded, politely picking at her food. She came around the frat looking for a date for you. Lucky for her I had just lost a drinking bet with my buddy Jase. Oh how lovely. Yeah, my buddies and I are always getting up to something like that. But I'm Vice President of the frat alliance, so thats lucky for you. Following in my dads footsteps. Ok, Anna was not quite sure how to respond to that. Um, what do you study? Sports management. Yeah, I should be graduating around March. Anna felt obliged to point out that nobody she had ever heard of had graduated in March, but she stayed silent and relished her lobster. Yeah, I got a pretty good metabolism, Landon said, unprovoked. Probably could order about fifty more of these wings if I wanted to. Anna wasnt sure if this was supposed to be impressive, but she was sure of one thing: the lobster was delicious. So, is your full name Peter? Anna sat in an upscale diner across from a short man shaped like a 6-year old boy. Naw, its just Pete. My parents named me that. Are you questioning my parents?! Oh! No, not at all. She hadnt expected him to take offense from this. I was just wondering. What is your occupation? she continued. Surely this simple question wouldnt anger him. Havent really got one, he said. I live with my parents. Pete Chang, 51, did indeed live with his parents. Mr. Chang was a dentist; Marcies dentist. If you may recall, Marcie was Annas roommate. Curse Marcie and her all-too frequent dental cleanings,  thought Anna. Are you ready to order? she said aloud. It was best to get the food and get out as quickly as possible. Sure, Ill have the CHICKEN NUGGETS! Pete said, raising his voice and turning directly towards the waiter.  Gourmet  chicken nuggets, he specified when the waiter came closer. No sauce. And Ill have a side of bread and French fries, and Sprite to drink. Glad theres no commitment here,  thought Anna.  Just a date between friends. Friends of friends. Well, friends of dentists friends, really. If I may ask, what made you want to go out with me? Anna asked, just trying to make conversation. I need to get married, Pete said bluntly. Annas water sprayed from her mouth involuntarily. Allergies? Pete questioned. Um sure, Anna responded. What kind of allergies would cause a person to do that, she was unsure. Anna felt uncomfortable approaching the subject again, and they stayed in silence until the food arrived. Bens childish meal was in contrast to her elegant salad, topped with delectable vegetables and a refined dressing. It was a diner, but a classy one, so long as you didnt order from the kids menu, like her date did. Why do you want to get married? Anna asked, finally reigning up the courage. My parents will says I have to get married before I inherit. Pete said, shoveling fries into his mouth. Dentist money, you know. Oh, how interesting, Anna said, stabbing an olive with her fork. Every dentist clinic you see around here, thats my dad, Pete said, before washing his bread down with a large gulp of Sprite and burping. My dad though, hes been in it for years. Works been hard on him. All those teeth. I cant imagine, said Anna politely. Anyway, hes getting old, doctor says he doesnt have much time left. He wont listen, just keeps on dentisting. Oh dear. Yeah, the moneyll be mine pretty soon. So what do you think? What do you think about what? Anna said, hoping it wasnt what she thought it was. Wanna marry me? he belched again. I dont think so. To-go box? she flagged down a waiter. Another failed date, another successful dinner. In my country, we no eat these how you say,  paellas . Boris Kazvolokoffs curly hair was all that was visible from behind a menu. It stuck up on its end like the Bride of Frankenstein, Anna observed. His thick foreign accent was only slightly more confusing than his blue tracksuit. They were at a Spanish restaurant, and Anna was contemplating ordering the  tortilla de patatas , doused in hot sauce. What is your country? Anna inquired. Oh, you could no pronounce it. Very strange reason for declining to answer me,  Anna thought.  Perhaps he is a foreign spy, here to assassinate our government leaders! I better eat fast. Boris was staring at his water in a very odd manner. When shall we have wedding? he asked. What?? asked Anna indignantly. You mail-order bride, are you not? I responded to an advertisement in the classifieds that my roommate Ivy showed me. I am not a mail-order bride! You are not mail-order bride? I am not mail-order bride! Two wedding proposals in a row was a bit of a headache. No matter, the  tortilla de patatas  was ravishingly divine. Night Five found Anna and her date at a sushi restaurant, famous for its made-from-scratch wasabi. Ben Quell, 32, was a confident man with a winning smile. While they munched on their food, she couldnt help but notice he was rather toned. Do you work out? she asked. I do, I certainly do. He spoke in short bursts, with huffy breaths in between. In fact, I jogged on the way over here. Thats quite impressive. I believe so. But I think even more important than physical fitness, is the teeth. Always make sure to brush your teeth. This guy was so easily distracted. I wouldnt dream of it, Anna said, in reference to the teeth. Wanna get together for brunch sometime? I like brunch. I like sushi. Which is why we are here. Oh, yes, of course, I like brunch though, I do. Thats nice. I think it is, hey, have you heard of Scientology? Sci-a-what? The religion. You see, its really quite fascinating- Ok, I think thats enough. Anna left the restaurant. The sushi was spectacular. The dazzling dress was in the dry cleaners. The old standby, her Little Black Dress, would have to do. Night Six was with a man Anna had met at the dry cleaners. Carter Rah, 29, had accidentally left his red sweater in her washer, dying all her white sheets an ugly pink. He asked if he could buy her dinner, by way of an apology. And Anna, as we know by now, is not one to turn down dinner. She met him outside of a snug Italian restaurant of her choosing. He pulled the seat back for her, and poured her water. He spoke with a smooth accent, slightly Egyptian in dialect. Do you fancy a scone? he asked.Yes, thank you so much. As to why there were scones in this Italian restaurant, Anna had no idea. But it was perfect. The dimly lit room with a small number of customers set the mood just right, and the sound of an elegantly played piano resonated in the background. Where is your family from? Anna could not help but be intrigued over his exotic accent. Egypt, originally, but my mum is from Great Britain. So I ended up with a sort of mix, I suppose. I think its lovely, Anna said, and for once her focus slipped away from food. Shall we order? Carter asked. Ah, yes of course, Anna responded. She was jolted back to Earth with the reminder of the real reason she was here. Anna ordered a light, creamy pasta, and Carter asked for a ravioli dish. They did not eat in silence, but rather exchanged stories. Anna told of growing up in New York City, and Carter of dividing his time between London with his mother, and Cairo with his father. He told magnificent tales of his travels with his father, the famed archaeologist. Carter detailed everything from the many historic ruins he had visited, to the meaning of Egyptians amulet symbols. He told the tales of the creation of the world, and of the sun god Ra, from which his name derived. Anna felt something that night. Something she had never felt before. But she pushed the feelings aside. She thanked Carter for the meal, and returned home, another night complete. British Hippie Rockstar was perhaps the best way to describe Rain Morrison. Annas gym teacher had met him at yoga class, and while he wasnt her type, she said Anna could do fine with him. This taco is lovely, that is, he said in a very thick British accent. Night Seven was located in a Mexican restaurant, and Anna had ordered a large taco plate. Rain had proceeded to steal one of the tacos, much to Annas disdain. He was dressed all in black, and smelled like a mix of cigarettes and essential oils. See the animals, this is what they eat. Guacamole? Anna asked, confused. Veg-e-ta-bles! Rain enunciated every syllable. Oh, yes vegetables. I suppose animals do eat that. See, I learn from them. The vegetables? The animals! Rain was completely animated. I go to a zoo, I learn from them. Oh, youre a zookeeper? she queried. No, I dont work there. I go to LEARN from them. Animals, see, they know everything. They have the key to the universe in their pockets. Animals have pockets? Pockets of the MIND! Where they store all of the information! This guy was off his rocker. But the guacamole tacos, those were right on the nail, whatever the animals might say. I never had much time for dating, Date Number Eight said. Too caught up in the academic world, one might say. Prof.Thomas Timothy Worthington-Bumberson, PhD, age 36, was a professor of medieval looms and weaving. He looked like a man out of time- he wore a tweed jacket and little round glasses. He wasnt old, but his dress and demeanor made him seem so. Anna got the feeling that he had dressed like this since his college days. Probably his whole life, in fact. I daresay, this scotch is mightly fine! Prof. Worthington-Bumberson, PhD, said. I should note; he was not British. What does your academic life entail? Anna asked. Oh, you know, the usual, he responded, lectures, research, teaching, loom-bearing, loom-whistling, loom-seeking. Oh how interesting. And what made you study the loom? Anna peered out the window cautiously. They were at a restaurant in a high-rise building, with much too many glass windows for her nerves.What made me study the loom? Loom-researching, loom-surveying, loom-excavating. That sort of thing just piqued my interest, and I knew it would be my lifes work. You should come to one of my lectures sometime! Anna couldnt hear him. She was much too busy stuffing herself with tomato risotto. The plan was over. Every dish was clean, and her bank statement remained the same. She had gotten everything she wished for, but something was missing. These eight days had changed her. The search for food had been fulfilled, yet still she hungered. She found herself opening her drawer- the linen drawer. Her spare sheets splotched with an ugly pink. Anna knew what she had to do. She scrolled through her contact, past washed-up Stanley Penton, spoiled frat boy Landon Hunter Bryce III, man-boy Pete Chang, suspected foreign spy Boris Kazvolokoff, Scientologist Ben Quell, cigarette-smoking hippie Rain Morrison, and time-traveling Prof.Thomas Timothy Worthington-Bumberson, PhD. All these names, but one stood alone, a name that taught her that she wasnt quite as heartless as she once thought. She pressed the words, Carter Rah and it only took one ring before he answered the phone.
Sonya is a 12 year old girl, an only child white hair freckles on her face. She is five feet two inches tall. That took forever, I said, panting where you were, my mom said with a soft smile. I... I was at the park, I said trying not to smile ok uh I gotta go do homework bye. I rushed to my room leaving a dust trail behind me. I got in my room and locked the door phew, Tap Tap what was that? It was my snotty 6 year old neighbor Jackie. what do you want! I saidopening my window did you hear about the dog show? No and I don't want to enter!!!	Ring Ring Ring what was that? Oh its just the clock, It was 1am in the morning and I sprang out of bed got to go! I said enthusiastically (even though it was the most tired Id ever been.) I climbed out of my window trying not to wake my parents as my feet hit the ground. You could hear the gravel crunching beneath my feet. I hopped on our new shiny red vespa vroom, vroom how do you start this thing? I thought to myself. I was shaking trying to figure out how to move then VROOM!!! AHHHHHHHHH I screamed as the vespa took off and flew down the road.	I could feel the cold air soaring through my hair as I zoomed past everything I saw. I drove up the alleyway and saw my favorite little pup named cinnamon. He is a golden lab mix. He always ran into stuff when he saw me cinnamon only does that when he is excited. Hey buddy, how you doing? I asked. He gave a loud bark in return, I got some food for you I searched in my bag and found a bag of dog food, here you go boy! He started wagging his tail back and forth. I could tell he was happy. Crunch Crunch Crunch, in a few minutes all the dog food was gone.   	All done boy? Do you want a drink of water? I asked cinnamon and he barked in agreement. Splish splash splish went the water as I poured it in the dog bowl. I got to go boy. Ill be back soon. I said with a frown on my face ok vespa lets try this again I thought to myself. I hopped on the vespa and rode away. I saw my house in the distance but tried to sneak around the back and hop the fence and there I saw my mom. 	I panicked as I saw my mom's red and blue rob through the gate of our house. I had just opened the door when I heard my moms voice honey where have you been, I came to your room last night and you weren't in your bed, why? My mom asked. The truth is my friends wanted me to egg a house but I knew it was a bad idea so I got home as fast as I could. I said trying to sound realistic. I knew I could not hide this for much longer but I had to keep lying to save my buddy cinnamon. Oookk sure I believe you this time but next tell me first said my mom. I breathed a sigh of relief as I walked into my room. It was 8 am and I had to get ready for school. I packed up my pink leather backpack and ran out the door to catch the bus.	As I walked on the bus I was panting from running so hard I was almost late for school but then I saw hope my best friend jennie! Jenniee! I screamed softly. Hey girl wassup she responded. You were almost late, I know. I said. But as soon as we finished talking the bus zoomed off and we were late! We had arrived at school and ready to start the day. We had entered s.t.e.m class just when the fire alarm went off RING RING RING god its so loud. I thought to myself.	I ran outside with all the other kids and sat on the grass and talked with Jenniee. I told her about cinnamon and she wanted to see him fine. I said softly so nobody can hear about cinnamon. I just got home when my mom said can we have a talk yeah why? I talked to jennie's mom she said jennie was home the day I found you outside in the morning, is there something you would like to tell me? My mom asked no nothing Are you sure? she questioned. Yep I answered, trying to sound calm.	I was really starting to stress out because I knew if I told them about cinnamon they would throw him in the pound. But I had to go to jennies house and take her to cinnamon. Mom I'm going over to Jennie's, I'll be back around 5pm! I screamed, ok. exclaimed my mom. I hopped back on the shiny red vespa (side note I kind of scratched it heh heh,) and I rode away. As I got to Jennies house I could see her waiting outside their door. Hey Jennie, I screamed trying hard to make her hear me. Umm so do you want to hop on my vespa to see cinnamon or what? I asked.	Uh yeah duh, exclaimed Jennie. She hopped on my vespa and we rode to the alleyway where cinnamon was laying down in his little dog house. I made him woof woof. I could hear the faint sounds of his bark. Cinnamon! Here, boy, do you want some water and dog food? He wagged his tail in agreement. Aww he is so cute, Jennie screamed with joy. She looked as excited as a kid on their birthday. Cinnamon once again lapped up his water and chowed down on his food but then he got super hyped and started running around like the flash!   	We were getting ready to leave just when cinnamon hopped on the vespa and it seemed like he wanted to go home with us. Uh cinnamon what are you doing? I asked he just barked with his tail hitting the keys making it seem like it was going to start NO CINNAMON! Jennie and Sonya yelped. We both hopped on the red vespa with cinnamon on it and it started going forward to our house! AHHHHHHHHHH!! Jennie and I screamed.	We were on the vespa zooming with cinnamon towards jennies and my house (we live next to each other). As we got closer I could see my mom up ahead with Jennies mom. They were talking about something. We heard a thunk and then we all flew off the vespa and landed on the grass. I awoke to a tongue licking my face Cinnamon is that you? I said weakly. Honey, are you ok? Asked my mom, I could tell she was concerned yeah Im fine. Wait, where's cinnamon? Whos cinnamon? My mom asked.	Uh no one Its the dog right Is this why you're sneaking out late all this time? she asked? Yeah Well you're grounded for a long time but I think you should have just told me that you found this dog I would have helped you with him.	 I know but I was afraid that you would throw him in the pound No, I would never do anything like that. I have always wanted a dog. Really? yeah. and i think we should keep him. Exclaimed my mom.	Yay thank you mom! But you're grounded and you have to take care of him all the time. I know and I will. We lived happily ever after and me, cinnamon and my mom all still look the same. The end.
Sitting in room 202 Amelia. She is the sweetest girl ever known and  NEVER EVER  broke a rule. But one day after all room 202 left for summer break she saw something that had a red tablecloth on it.

I dont want to ever so much as see crystals around here again Lissette! You do know this is what got your mother killed, dont you? Aunt Ivys pine green eyes shift back and forth, examining Lissettes tawny diamond shaped face.But its also what made her feel alive. Lissette responds. I dont understand how you so easily turned your back on our traditions all those years ago. What? Simply because youre scared?Fear isnt always a bad thing Lissette. Youre young, so you think you know everything, but you dont. Please just stop with the magic. I already lost Ava, The name catches in her throat. Dont make me lose you too.Lissette rushes to the circular wooden door leading out to Willowdale. No one, not even Aunt Ivy, can take away what still connects Lissette to her mother. The one thing that brings joy in this dreary life. She strides towards the forest, where its safe to be herself.Hey there, whats the rush Lissette?Shes startled out of her focused march by his chin length black hair and icy blue eyes. Her heart stops for a moment along with her feet. Oh, hey Peter. Just, She glances over at the small open market. Out doing some chores for Ivy. Bread and all that.Ah. Would you like some company? He asks. Lips twisting into a half smirk.No, its fine. Im kind of in a rush.He bows slightly. As you wish gorgeous.She hopes he cant tell shes blushing and glances down as she moves onward. Lissette stops by the market just in case Peters still in the area.She lazily inspects the bakers selection and overhears the conversation of two women behind her.I cant believe it. How did this happen when the Inquisoris been so good about eradicating witchcraft?Lissettes ears perk up at the word witchcraft.People can be sneaky. You never know what someones hiding.Yeah, but the Gargantha lurking in the forest is not something easily hidden.Those monsters are born rather small, or so Ive heard.A Gargantha is created out of someones insecurities, secret longings, and regrets. The mage gains someones trust, usually with the help of illusory magic to get the to the core of that person. Lissette despises crooked magic, but its what people generally associate with witchcraft. She buys a loaf of bread and walks back to the cottage. If a Gargantha is out there right now, Lissette would need to go into the forest more prepared than she is.Scents of a meaty stew swirl throughout the cottage, and Ivys more focused on the pot in the kitchen than shed normally be. Good, shell probably ignore Lissette for a while. She slinks into her room which barely has enough space for her twin sized bed.Lissette places the bread and satchel on her miniature bedside dresser. She pulls off her blood red cloak over her thick curly hair and lays on the bed in her puffy white shirt and loose pants. She takes her notes and pen from the dresser.Use magic to defeat magic. Lissette pulls three empty sheets of thick yellowing paper from the stacks. She draws the symbol for verity. Three dots inside a triangle. Water, a circle with a t through the middle and raindrops in each of the four parts of the open circle. Fire, a diamond holding a flame inside. Truth and these elements are what best counteract illusory magic which creates a Gargantha. Lissette spends hours perfecting the symbols.She puts her cloak and satchel back on, placing the symbols inside the bag. She walks out to the living room holding the bread and finds Ivy sitting on the couch reading a novel. Barely looking at the table beside her, Ivy lifts her teacup and sips while reading.Lissette almost tells her about the plan. Maybe knowing that shes using her powers for good will lighten Ivys views on it, but Lissette stops herself from saying anything. Shell tell Ivy after shes victorious.Hearing Lissettes footsteps, Ivy says, Help yourself to some of the stew. She doesnt take her eyes off the novel.Thanks. I brought some more bread if you want any.Mm.Lissette puts the bread on the counter and walks out to Willowdale. She spots Peter sitting below a tree playing the lute, and he glimpses her way just after she looks at him. Lissette quickly glances back down, but its too late. He walks over to her with a full smile on his moonlight face.Out and about twice in one day. This is rare for you. He says.While youre always out on the town. She retorts. He raises an eyebrow, conscious of the double meaning in her words. Shes seen him walking around with almost all of the other young women in Willowdale. Hell usually play them a song or two before moving on to the next one. She crosses her arms.Is that such a bad thing? I cant imagine how boring it must be to just sit in your room all day.Nope. Not boring. Peaceful. She continues walking. Anyways, if youll excuse me, I have things to do. She glances at his blue eyes one last time and jumps back at the intensity of his gaze.Huh. Well then, Lissette. Enjoy your day. He walks back to the tree and starts playing his lute.Though shes had a slight distant crush on Peter for a while, he hasnt spoken to her much like he has today. She never realized he noticed her introverted ways like shes noticed his extroverted ones. Lissette shakes her head. Hes just curious because she appears like a mystery.Lissette pulls on her satchel and thumbs through the three papers. Hopefully this works. The most shes ever done are simple spells to help around the house or change energy. Shes never used magic for anything on this scale before. She ambles to the forest on the long trail out of town. Feigning interest in a light green plant with deep red dots, Lissette kneels down and touches one of the waxy leaves. Maybe shes not the one who should go defeat the Gargantha.Dont doubt yourself. This is what I want you to do. Avas voice nudges inside her head.Lissette stands back up and walks with determination. Plants on each side of her sway in the wind. Her moms presence guides Lissette forward, even if its simply in her imagination.Standing at the base of the entrance to the forest, she inhales and exhales a long, deep breath. Wind slows, expansive silence covering the dimming area. The sun falls on the horizon to her right as the moon lightly hangs in the other side of the sky. Lissette enters between the trees and listens for any footsteps or sounds from the Gargantha. Though she knows how one is made, she doesnt know what they look like.Time passes, and as darkness covers the forest Lissette wonders if what she heard in the market was merely a rumor. Her ankles throb and she sits down for a break.Whispers flow around Lissette, and the back of her neck tingles. She sees no sign of anyone or anything in the area.The words are barely distinct. Not good enough. Why try if youre going to fail anyways? Save yourself the embarrassment. Not good enough.She stands up but sees nothing from any direction.Something must be wrong with you. Your time has already passed. Its too late for you to become an actress. You never would have made it to the city anyways. Not good enough.Lissettes eyebrows knead together. Shes never wanted to become an actress.Bushes shift, and the brushing sound covers the whispers that were there seconds before. Lissette turns towards them, biting her lower lip.Peter emerges from the bushes, and she backs away as he comes closer.She blurts, What are you doing out here?I could ask you the same question, Lissette. Except I already know why youre here.Without glancing behind, she backs into a tree. She looks around for an escape route.The full extent of my charms didnt work on you earlier because while I am a wizard, youre a witch. Though, he smirks, You are attracted to me without the excess.She shakes her head and feels through the satchel.You dont need to destroy my precious Gargantha. Imagine instead, how powerful we could be together. We could stop the Inquisori from trying to destroy magic. Average people are scared now, but we can make them fear us to the point where they wont try to erase us anymore.I dont do magic to hold a twisted power over others. Lissette pulls out the verity symbol and sways her arms until a slight glow circles around her.Oh come now, Im not going to do anything to hurt you. Im on your side. Youre not the only one whos lost someone for our practices. His eyes are earnest for a moment.And what of the girl who you used illusory magic on? Its evil Peter. Youve altered who she is forever. Those thoughts will always be at the forefront of her mind now.Isnt every human impacted in some way or another by those they come in contact with? Im just a more powerful force than the average person. Besides, maybe shell actually do something to change her reality with all those thoughts floating around her mind.Lissette shakes her head, and her eyes widen at the sound of a tree slamming into the ground.A large, rounded violet creature waddles behind Peter. It has craters all over its body, indents where the eyes should be. Whispers of, Not good enough, murmur through the Gargantha.Lissette pulls out the water symbol, but the moment her verity shield is down, Peter uses wind magic to push the papers out of her hands and satchel.She turns and runs for the symbols, but the distance between her and the papers is futile. Lissette isnt practiced enough to use magic without them. How did you learn to use magic without the use of symbols? She asks Peter.I had a wonderful teacher. A bit quieter, he says, She was the person I lost.Lissettes lips part, but she cant think of a response.Get away from her!Lissette and Peter turn to see Ivys broad form. Elbows out to her sides and a ball of water flowing through the air between her hands. With the force of a tidal wave, it lunges for the Gargantha.Peter directs wind towards Ivy, but hes too late to counteract her practiced force.A loud screech emerges from the Gargantha. Deep shadows of pain are in every note of disharmony, and the Gargantha transforms into a shadow itself before evaporating into the aether.The ball of water is motionless once more between Ivys hands. She gives Peter the most intimidating look Lissette has ever seen from her aunt. This is a side to Ivy Lissette had a vague idea of but never expected to know. Shes never even seen her aunt use charms since her aversion to magic started around the time Lissette was born.Run. Ivy commands, and Peter darts in the opposite direction of Willowdale.When hes completely out of sight, Ivy releases the magic and sighs. Good. I thought I was actually going to have to hurt the kid. She turns to Lissette, who looks at the ground.Lissette asks, How did you find me here?I may not have purposely used magic in a long time until now, but intuition is my strongest gift. One that Im happy I cant get rid of. She pauses. Did you not know the Gargantha and wizard were out here?I did. Well, I didnt know Peter would be out here, but I knew the Gargantha would. I overheard it at the market. Lissette looks directly into Ivys eyes. Its just, I thought that if I defeated it and told you about it after, youd see why I should keep practicing magic. I want to use my powers for good. She pauses. Though, Im beginning to see I barely even have any power.Ivy shakes her head. Come, lets go back to the cottage. Its already dark, and we dont want anyone to see us walk out of the forest at midnight.They move side by side in silence for a long time. As they approach the exit, Ivy says, Your mother isnt the only person Ive lost to magic. There are more ways to lose someone than death alone.Lissette glances at Ivy and waits for her to continue.The wizard, Peter you said? He probably didnt start off using illusory magic. Some magicians change when they get a taste of power. It becomes an addiction to ease the tsunamis within themselves. She wistfully gazes at the stars. Growing up, youve never seen me have a long term companion. And its because my heart is a ghost for someone whos alive but no longer exists. Someone who I lost to that addiction. It will break my heart to the point of no return if I lost you the way I lost her or your mom.But thats not who I am. Its not who mom was. Tears form at the edges of Lissettes eyes, but she resists the urge to wipe them away. And shes still with me despite what they did to her. I wont become like Peter or the person you loved, but I wont back down to the Inquisori either.Ivy stops walking and Lissette does the same. Ivy says, What Im about to say comes with a heavy heart. You need to leave Willowdale.What? Im not leaving you here alone. Isnt that what youre afraid of? Lissette shakes her head.Theres a school out west where you can learn the practice, but they will also teach you the self control required for true strength. And youre not going to stay here, where the Inquisori rule with an iron fist. The west is more open minded about magic.Well then, maybe you can come with me.Ivy shakes her head. No. I used magic today, but I will not sway from the life Ive chosen for myself. Yet, I realize it would be selfish of me to keep holding you back from the life you want for yourself. You can lead a safer life there than in Willowdale. We can still write to each other and visit occasionally. Neither of us will be truly alone.Lissette embraces Ivy as tears stream down her cheeks. Thank you, Ivy. I wont change.You will change. But some of the teachers at Vixose are from my past life, and I trust the change in you wont be for the worse. I will draw out a map for you tomorrow and write the letter to the dean. But you will pay for the carriage with the earnings you made from your summer job.Lissette pulls back. You always were a cheapskate.They laugh and walk the rest of the way home under a full moon.
Every morning for five years, Driss helped his father's workers to take care of the farm animals before carrying a plastic bag as a satchel to school four miles from the farm. Each day at 5 p.m. he returned home to help out on the farm again. He was forbidden to open his notebooks to revise at night because he had to get up early to help on the farm before leaving for school.His family's idea of the boy's future is to grow up, then quit school, work on the farm and get married with his sole qualification of knowing how to write his name and surname. In the kid's mind, he must study to become a pilot or a doctor or both.His wish to become a pilot came from his meeting, on the way to school, with a woman who told him about her pilot son by pointing a plane in the sky. His desire to become a doctor came to him from his uncle who repeatedly told stories about the skills, the kindness, the wealth of all the doctors he has consulted in his life.Every September at the start of the school year there was discussions about whether the boy was continuing school or not, each time it ended with screaming and crying and at the end they agreed to buy some notebooks and pens for the school year.Five years after the boy passed a national exam to go to college. Therefore, he must leave the farm and go to the next town. The farm will lose a worker and the boy will cost the family money because he will live away from them. The discussion lasted most of the summer until one day his uncle showed up at the farm with a bag of medicine and handed the boy a handwritten medical prescription asking him to explain the doctor's conclusions about his condition.The boy was not unable to read a word of this medical prescription. The uncle laughed at him in front of all family's members and added the boy should continue studying because he is far from becoming a doctor. Then his mother decided the boy should continue to attend school until he acquires the knowledge necessary to understand a medical prescription.He went home every vacation. He told his family stories at mealtimes: stories of opposing political currents and ensuing wars, stories of conquest of one country by another, the existence of several civilizations from several continents, thousands of languages spoken in the world. He opened their imaginations beyond the mountains that surround their farm by repeating what he had learned in school, scientific stories where he explained the solar system, the galaxies, and that the stars are suns and there are billions of them in billions of galaxies.The adolescent becomes the sources of knowledge of this lost farm, the source of information which fills the lack of radio and television. The boy won the hearts of his family and won the lifetime ticket to go to school no matter what. It became very difficult for his family when it is time for him to leave home for school after the holidays, especially the summer holidays where he helpes a lot on the farm.Seven years passed when the young man graduated from high school and enrolled in the university with no one on the farm knowing what kind of study he was pursuing. Without delaying on his daily life, every school year, he wore the same shirt, the same pants, the same shoes and cut his hair once a year. Despite his repeated successes in his studies, the boy felt lonely every time he left his family to go to school, it broke his heart. The exams scared him because he had to pass, but he never complained. In the minds of his family and friends, the boy is smart but in his own mind, he was not. His success comes from his hard work.Five years later, the boy announced to his family that he has obtained an excellence scholarship to prepare his doctorate in a foreign country about 1600 miles away from the farm. In the spirit of his kin the boy will become a doctor.His family bought him clothes, a suitcase, a plane ticket and gave him $ 442. The departure was difficult for him and his family. But for him, the feeling of going to a foreign country, discovering a new culture and meeting other scientists outweighed his sadness. He did not see his family for three years, the only contact he had with them was the phone from time to time. He never spoke about the difficulties he encountered in keeping his family out of trouble.Four years later, the young man defended his PhD thesis in mathematics. He never told his parents and no one knew that he was graduated and started working as an associate professor at an university in the same country. His great satisfaction comes from sending money to his family to help them buy food, medicine and for the education of his siblings and every summer he visited them and had good time with them.One day he saw a doctor for the flu. The doctor gave him a printed medical prescription written on his computer. This time he managed to read the prescription clearly. It wasn't that kind of handwritten prescription that only pharmacists can decipher.He dialed his father's number to tell him that he finally managed to read a prescription even though he still couldn't understand it. They laughed together, and his father told him that he is an amazing boy and he is proud of him because he made it out of the farm. His father explained to him that he knew that the road was difficult and that the medical prescription was a challenge which helped him to overcome any difficulties.Thanks to an illegible medical prescription, Driss currently teaches and does research at the university. He has three children of his own. He pushes them hard to study but like him, they hate studies, a secret that has never been revealed to anyone. For him, studies were a loophole to get rid of the chores of the farm.(please forgive my english)
A misplaced boyhood adventure could have meant not only the final Summer of elementary school for myself and my best friend. It could, theoretically, have resulted in the last summer on this earth for both of us.Sure, we had bent the rules many times in the past--like the time we stole Old Man Pintos grapes and escaped serious injuries after scaling his fence just ahead of the guard dogs in his backyard vineyard. Seldom, however, had we actually put our lives on the line with this little escapade and a number of others stretching throughout our pre-teen yearsThis particular summer, however, really had registered near the top--or the bottom--of the boredom scale--depending which way you looked at it. So it didnt take alot of persuading to get me involved when my lifelong best friend, Tommy, mapped out his plans for the great adventure the August before we had to drag our sorry asses back to begin our last year of elementary school before entering the esteemed ranks of high school freshmen.I know we havent seen the kind of action that I expected this year, I replied when I heard the plan. The constant boredom actually has made me almost look forward to having our days taken up with studying and putting up with teachers, the so-called food they serve in school lunches and the little free time we get during gym and recess--not.Tommy shot back, I dont look forward to the Days of the Dungeon anymore than you do. Thats why I really wish we had something to write about--or at least hide about writing about--when Miss Crabtree tells us to scribble a homework assignment about What I Did During My Summer Vacation.Youre right about one thing, though, if any summer adventure rates on the Top Ten it cant be something you would want the school authorities--or the cops--to get involved in.In any event, my blood brother and I began looking for some type of mischief to get into along Court Street in our boyhood neighborhood of Elizabethport, NJ. Besides the excitement factor, we had to prove that we could get away with something and that we didn't totally lack imagination.Finally, the answer to our prayer loomed ahead of us--about five city blocks from our home, a huge railroad bridge--or at least it seemed huge to our just-developing pre-teen eyes--stretched across the local freightyard tracks.Tommy said, It will take us an extra 10 minutes to walk around the bridge if we stick to the slow-poke legal route along the sidewalk on either side of the bridge--why dont we take a shortcut?It sounds like you are bucking for a ticket to the insane asylum. Do you really want to cross the tracks? We could get run over by a freight train--or at the very least--get some serious hurt both from the authorities and our parents.Thats the adventure part, he yelled as we climbed the embankment. Besides, if we run fast enough neither the train nor the authorities will even suspect that we took this alternate route. Almost all the guys at our school do it.Fortunately--or so we thought--when we got to the top of the bridge we found no signs of swift-moving caravans of freight, Deputy-Dog-type railroad police or the city cops.I think we made it, Tommy yelled, as we ran along the tracks and began hauling our bodies as fast as we could down the other side of the bridge.Oh! Oh! Not quite as easy as we thought--just as we got to the end of the bridge and ran down to the other side of Court Street I thought I saw someone about 20 yards behind us and closing fast.Dont worry. Just some hobo looking for a place to have a few snorts of booze and sleep off a hangover in one of the boxcars. Hes nobody to worry about, Tommy screamed.Nevertheless, we ran even faster, just in case Tommy's theory was completely wrong.Turns out my esteemed blood brother came out on the low end of the intelligence scale again. Waiting on the street below was a railroad detective, who quickly rounded us up and put us into the back seat of his car--locking the doors from the outside with a gadget next to his steering wheel.After loudly holding forth with a two-minute lecture on the hazards and regulation violations of crossing the railroad tracks--it seemed like almost an hour--he took down our names and addresses and deposited each of us into the custodies of our not-too-happy parents.Tommys parents had called mine and the four of them had gathered at my house--and not for a neighborhood barbeque. Luckily, after our arrival after school stretched into an hour of lateness approaching dark, our parents spent a great deal more time worrying about our safety than about potential punishments. When the railroad detective brought us home to family dinners now cold, awaiting our arrival, they greeted us more with hugs and open arms than with scornful revenge in their eyes.They also convinced the railroad detective to let us take care of this in our own way, and he agreed not to take it further.Of course, our safe return did not not completely let us off the hook. The two of us earned some major grounding time from our respective parents, and they scheduled alot more time for catching up on our studies during our last few days of vacation than allowing us to create new adventures--but we figured we still got off easy.Needless to say, on strict orders for our parents, little word of our late-Summer exploration managed to work its way into school compositions or the local rumor mill.Our parents didnt feel like dealing with disapproving gossip about their disciplinary methods coming from our much-too-nosy neighbors. They also didnt want our ventures into Tom Sawyer-land serving as guidelines to future delinquency for the other youngsters in our area.The exploration, therefore, has remained locked in the annals of our respective families until now.
I will admit to being an ardent rule-follower. Both the fear of discovery and public shaming factor into my strict adherence to regulations. Yet inwardly, I often admire and applaud the courage of rule-breakers. Occasionally, my fellow rule-followers and I step out of our comfort zones, and if we are rewarded for our bravery, the thrill is something we never forget.	After my husband and I sold our downtown Chicago condo, we crammed our SUV and headed south to deposit the furnishings at our winter getaway.One hour into the eighteen-hour drive, our pregnant daughter living in New Jersey shot me a text she was in the hospital with preeclampsia.Two weeks shy of a full-term pregnancy, our grandson would make an early debut into the world.	Fortunately, first babies take their time, even when doctors choose to induce. My husband and I continued our cross-country trek. We crossed the Florida state line, stuffed our belongings into the condos cupboards and closets, grabbed a few hours of sleep, and repacked for a morning flight to Newark.First stop: the Mother-Child unit to cuddle and welcome a healthy but small new grandson. Second stop: my daughters home to put order in an unassembled nursery.	Before my grandson and his folks pulled into their driveway, Id racked up seven round trips to the hospital, three trips to unfamiliar grocery and drug stores, and washed and folded countless loads of tiny baby clothes and blankets. The getting-ready-for-baby-to-come-home to do list made me (almost) forget the chaos Id left behind in the Florida condo. Mostly, I longed for a familiar bed and pillow, and the return to my daily yoga and exercise routine. So, once the baby and his parents were home and settled in for naps, I treated myself to a walk.	Between my daughters house and the village of Morristown, signs for a nature area popped up. Im no stranger to walking in the woods. I love to observe nature and snap photos. So, my seasoned sneakers left the unforgiving, cement sidewalk to crunch on acorns and wood chips. And instead of car exhaust and grass clippings, the scent of decaying leaves, damp earth, and sweet clover drifted around me in a late-summer breeze. As I walked along the paths, a faint, rhythmic rush like water trickling intensified.When the narrow trail emptied into a clearing, I surveyed a rich landscape hidden from the bustling village road.	Water careened over a metal plate beneath a narrow, wooden footbridge. A lagoon, its root beer colored water, meandered helter-skelter through shoulder-high wetland grasses. Here and there, box turtles paddled and climbed onto sunny perches. Milk pods and seed-heads swayed like the bows in an orchestral string section.Like a magnet, the tranquility of the preserve pulled me deeper into its secluded core. I continued my explorations.	Around the back of the lagoon, the mulched path Id been traversing split in two. Two orange cones prevented me from accessing the waters edge. Above my head, a white metal sign stated:	DO NOT WALK ON PATH DURING CONSTRUCTION.	Beyond this roadblock, I spied movement at the center of the lagoon. I puzzled the sign and the cones blocking the path. I cursed both as I observed the fluttering movements of a bird coming to rest in the water. I held my breath. I knew that profile: a blue heron! On the other side of the orange cones, I noticed footprints had already scarred the newly constructed trail.Deer, dogs, and man-made treads had trespassed before my arrival. I wasnt the only soul who had considered the merits of the signs warnings. I scanned the area for signs of pedestrians or construction workers who might catch me in civil disobedience, and then darted quickly to the lagoons shore. Poised, as if hunting a mid-morning snack, a mature blue heron held court. I held my breath and fished out my iPhone from my jean pocket and captured the image. Stunning.	Feeling cocky, I savored the reward of my disobedience by posting it to Instagram, and then I sheepishly backtracked to the trailhead where the orange warning cones waited. I wasnt ready to go home. I picked up the adjacent trail which looped through the woods, around a deserted grammar school playground, and deposited me onto a residential sidewalk.Ahead of me, on the playgrounds baseball diamond, I made out the shape of what looked like a loose dog rolling around in the mud at first base.	As the animal somersaulted in the dust, scratching maniacally, something about the dog looked peculiar.The animals thin, lengthy tail and lanky form screamed canine, but the small, triangular face did not.I edged closer and reached for my cell phone again. I snapped a few photos and zoomed in to study the result of my efforts. The critter fifteen feet in front of me was not a household pet playing hooky from a fenced-in yard. It was an immature fox with a nasty case of fleas.	As I hiked back to my daughters house, I thought about how my thrilling and flagrant disregard for the sign and construction cones had been doubly rewarded.I applauded my good fortune. I was lucky. The trail construction was on hiatus. Forest rangers who normally patrolled the area were on a coffee break. And other hikers, who may have frightened off both the heron and fox, were nonexistent.	One thing had led to another.	A build-up of inner tension due to family matters had led to my choosing to talk a walk. The neighborly stroll had led to civil disobedience, and that choice had led to a double reward: encounters with two unusual creatures smack dab in a residential neighborhood. I was twice blessed! First for venturing out in strange surroundings, and then for taking a calculated risk. Thanks to my grandson, I was in the right place at the right time. I nabbed two prize photos and no serious harm resulted from my blatant rule breaking.
Chitauri! hissed the nearest parent simulating android, after forcing the door and finding the damn lizard. Joey was speaking through the robot, Misty could tell.	Misty doesnt like the looks of the scaly green lizard man either. Its entire dimly lit apartment reeks of rotting meat. The teeth of the projecting jaw are yellow and crusted brown in places. Their sharp cusps indicate a meat-eating animal. Widely spaced slitted dark eyes, like those of an alligator, focused directly on her.	And who might you be? the monster asked. The mouth moved but there was some modulator at work making the words sound human, even upper-crust American.	Misty moved further into the large space, towards the kitchen wall, alert, with her hair-triggered enhanced taser projector leading the way. The half dozen teens in their school uniforms spread out brandishing their taser projectors while the several adult androids switch their stunners for something lethal.	She faces the creature and states My name is Misty Harte and I am a diplomatic operator working for Joey, the artificial intelligence that runs this solar system.	Ah, an AI. Didnt know there was one, the lizard says. It certainly made a mess of this operation. Now I know why we were so easily overcome.	Misty opens the door to the commercial-size refrigerator and gags, but without surprise. She has seen another alien lizard at Solomons temple on a history look-see with Joey. Raggedly stacked were leg and arm steaks, livers, ribs, and hearts; all human au jour.	Crikey! yelps one of the students before she barfs on her feet, still watchful with her gun covering Mistys moves.	And who are you? Misty asks the lizard through gritted teeth.	My name is Apep and Im the morale officer here, Apep said.	Misty is confused. This is a brainwashing facility producing Deltas for the Illuminati. Why would they care about the feelings of their victims? 	Before Apep can answer, Joey speaks to her through the android nearest her. He kills and eats the slower learners in front of the others. He provides more of an inspirational message.	I think we got all we need from you, Misty says and hopes it is so. Although her gun will only incapacitate the thing for several hours, she wants to kill it. She raises the weapon and fires, but to no effect.	Apep has an armored suit similar to yours, Joey tells her but does not instruct one of the androids to try one of their weapons of greater strength.	This room is weaponized, I can kill you all at any time, Apep announces calmly.	Maybe you can kill us but youll never get out of here alive! Misty spits.	I know that, the monster says, still sitting, seemingly relaxed.	While Misty glares at the monster a new android enters through the open door. Ive brought half a dozen more of us, a truck with the reprogramming equipment, and transport for the wounded, it says, addressing Misty.	Dont move a muscle! she demands of the lizard. 	Keep him covered! she says to the androids that are already covering him.	Come with me, she directs the newcomer. They cross the commons in front of the elevators and enter the other side of the building. There await thirty or so unconscious victims on hospital beds in various stages of the horrifically painful process of disillusional brainwashing.	Are the wounded being loaded? she asks over the patients.	Yes, commander, the human-looking machine says.	Commander? she questions.	I dont know what else to call you, so, you are promoted, Joey says through the android. Misty recognizes the inflection.	Ah, here come the programmers, says the android as other robots carry in the helmetish machinery. It takes months of constant hell to program a Delta or a sex slave, but Joeys machines will do a much better job in a couple of painless hours. The workers, androids, and students, leave the unconscious on the same beds while the tube affairs are removed and replaced with Joeys helmets.	So, in three hours, all their horrific memories will be replaced with pleasant ones. Then, are they going to be conscripted into your lost souls' army? Misty asks Joey through the robot.	The younger ones will. The older ones will be prophets of the new religion that were starting in Cincinnati.	The religion of the ancients? she asks.	Yes, the obvious and provable one. The one that reanimates your atoms after they fall into a living black hole. Their entering velocity and vector can be backtracked exposing every movement you have made, every thought.	What made the ancients think black holes are alive and smart enough to backtrack atoms? Misty asks with passive interest.	Intelligence is present in every atom but can only be expressed when the matter is lined up properly. When atoms are crushed to touching protons, really compressed, intelligence must work in that arrangement too. Thats a lot of intelligence. Joey explains.	But nothing can escape from a black hole, so I learned in school. How do they know for sure?	Its no more a leap of faith than any religion. However, a black hole ejects matter at the pole and some of it, that has passed close to the event horizon, is encoded by the resident."	Thats pretty strange, Misty states. Kind of like smoke signals.	30,000 light-years to Sagittarius A is a long distance, but the ancients traveled it. They claim that they dropped messages into the accretion disk and got a coded answer in the emissions at the pole.	If you dont mind, Ill hold onto my tithing, Misty tells him.	Ahem, says the nearest android, vying for attention. Were about done here and we have to clean up the mess in the rest of the building, it said.	Misty followed down to the second floor with its myriad of stunned guards along with the workers that were in the know. The four dozen people lay in rows, on their backs, in the common room. All the students stayed on the third floor, keeping a wary eye on the lizard. Some androids came down to assist. The eyes of the stunned followed them with gruesome fear as helmets were placed. Within three hours they would be well-adjusted profits with new backgrounds, personalities, looks, and identification.	I hate to do this to people, Misty said, but no person was there to hear, only androids. It had to be done, these workers were incorrigible, and Misty knew it.	The first floor was next and her heart went out for these people. They were the cover company and had no idea what happened on the second and third floors. They were conscious, they could hear, but they couldnt move or talk. Misty addresses them as a group.	Folks, she started, you now know that a serious criminal enterprise has been eliminated in this building. You have seen things you dont understand. You arent sure whether we or they are the bad guys, or maybe both. You dont want to make anyone angry, so this is what will happen.	She pauses for effect, trying to contact the fearful eyes of the stunned workers.	This paralysis will wear off in a few hours. We will be gone and any evidence in the top two stories will mean nothing to you or the police. Make up a story and stick to it. Make it different from your partner. Mix up your descriptions and tell them you think memory diffusing gas was used on you.	Misty looks around; she has been joined by the students that acted so valiantly during the assault. They move out of earshot of the stunned workers.	I have to finish with Apep but you should all board the bus. Ill be along in a few minutes, Misty tells her group before heading for the third floor.	Apep hadnt moved a muscle. It is now surrounded by two dozen lethally armed androids.	What should I do with the monster? Misty asked the nearest android but was really addressing Joey.	Youve done a wonderful job Commander. Get on the bus, come home and enjoy a few weeks with your husband. Do some busywork. Ill take care of Apep. Im afraid he will have to come up here into the moon. He has lots of information on the Illuminati that he has promised to provide, said Joey.	But he can kill us all, Misty reminded the AI.	Not outside of his mined room and once out, well, my assault rifles are lethal even with his armor.	Are they like military rifles? Misty asked, curious.	No. I call them proton poppers. They deliver stripped lead nuclei at near-light speed. Any one of these rifles could slice him right in half, Joey tells her.	Misty looks at the lizard man who has been listening. It smiles at her, sort of. She shrugs, says goodbye to the unfeeling androids, and rides down the elevator and out the door and across the unsuspecting street then onto the bus. A uniformed android driver immediately takes them smoothly away from the curb and into traffic. In an hour they exit onto the grass of the tree concealed glen and walk up the ramp into the large cylindrical spacecraft.	The wall goes transparent and Misty takes a comfortable seat where she can see the bus pull away. She expected to rise in short order but there seems to be a delay. She sits quietly, trying to relax, not really wanting to chat with her fellow raiders, all of them remembering the refrigerator. Within the hour a short bus arrives delivering a posse of androids. They dont enter the craft, however, but wait outside.	An 18-foot box truck pulls up as soon as the short bus leaves. Misty feels chills; the bad kind. The door is cranked upward and the lizard hops out not needing the ramp. It is unbound and makes for the ships graded entry while not showing any surprise at finding a large spacecraft before it. Once inside it selects a seat beside Misty. It smiles, sort of, the breath exuding from between those teeth dumbfounding her.	One of the androids moves to stand in front of her stricken face.	It is only a three-hour journey. the robot says. Misty begins to tremble but the robot quickly points a stun rifle and blasts the lizard off of its seat to thump roughly onto the floor. Its eyes radiated hate but its breath is turned aside as is any conversation.	Misty stretched her chair into a lounge and rested, the brute near but out of sight. She is exhausted, it had been a long day. She didnt resist a snooze and the next thing she knew she was roused by the bustle of those around her falling in line at the exit. She chose the bus to shuttle to her home region and opted for a private shuttle to take her to her house.	Her husband Sam was waiting on the front porch.	What happened to your neck? Joey didnt tell me much, just affirmed that you were OK. But the bruise! What the hell!	He led her inside and started a warm bath. After easing into it Misty unrolled the whole story while he sat, rapt, shaking his head between fear and admiration. She told him how she had charged an armed squad of killers and caught a bullet on the side of the neck. Joeys armor had saved her life but she did get a bruise. He had prepared her favorite dinner and afterward, they went to bed. Misty slept like the dead and lingered several hours past her usual rise time.	Homelife with Sam is good but after two weeks of busywork, Misty grew bored. It was then that Joey sent a message, asking if he could stop by. That night he was invited to dinner. Its android appeared as a handsome blonde of six foot two, clean-shaven and healthily muscled. He wore European casual clothing in the current style. His greeting was amiable and they chatted easily over dinner until Misty brought them around to business.	So, hows the lizard? she asked.	Its provided quite a bit of information, Joey offered.	Do you make human meat for it to eat? she asks. Joey starts with chlorella, supplementing as needed, and ends up with oil, gas, plastic, and food. Joeys machinery is so advanced that green slime can be processed into steaks that cant be distinguished from the real thing.	No. Apep eats chicken, Joey informs her.	Hes an animal, Misty states.	He works for humans that willfully harm more people while showing less empathy than he does, Joey says. Misty displays an understood but unhappy look. Weve cleaned him up and insist that he maintain a hygienic appearance. Weve cleaned his teeth.	Fine. So what now?	 Apep has informed me that his boss, that he never met, her being several steps up at the top of the Illuminati, was descended from Belarus nobility by the name of Sarah Zbaraski, wife of Alexandria. Sarah was from a century of Texan oil money before she married into the Ruthenium royalty. She is fervent in her desire to reduce the peasant population at all costs, to them, using climate change as an excuse and leaving more for her as an impetus. Some old royals think they have the right to cull the herd, so she fits in.	Well, sure, leaders make decisions that kill people all the time. We just chalk it up to incompetence, Misty supplied.	Then you shouldnt be so naive, in the case of Sarah, anyway, Joey cautions. This is what I want you to do. Take her place.	But I have a husband! Misty rebels.	I have an android that looks just like her and I got you invited to a party of her inner circle with emissaries from the Bilderbergs, Satanists, Dajjal, Freemasons, all hosted by the Illuminati.	A party? Doesnt sound so bad, Misty mused.	There are human sacrifices.	There was an unexpected knock at the door. Sam rose to answer it.	Jesus! he exclaims from the foyer. A cleaner Apep moves toward them from around the corner. 	Shit! exclaims Misty. With its clean teeth and crocodile eyes, it smiles at her, sort of.	Youre going to have to take Apep with you to get inside, Joey explains.	Im not real keen on traveling with a purple people eater! she exclaims.	Green, Apep corrects.	Can I go? Sam asks.	Arrivals are expected in five hours, Joey states. On cue, an ambiguous android pulled a clothing cart into the house and over to them. They change clothing heedless of the others. Soon they take a fast private shuttle to the hangar and board the small, at 75 meters in diameter, Earth transport.	Who are you? Misty asked the woman already seated.	Sarah Zbaraski, she stated, raising from her seat to offer her hand, which Misty and then Sam shook. Sarah showed no fear of the lizard.	 Youre the android? Misty asked and Sarah nodded. The ride was uneventful and they transferred into the usual opaqued Tesla, this one with a posh trailer to accommodate Apep. Soon they were out of the customary glade and traveling the streets of Sambuca, Sicily. They passed Selinunte over palazzos adorned with gargoyles and cherubs to finally pass through a guarded gate. Soon, the valet was taking their car at the entry of the remodeled monastery. The android had donned a veil and chain leashes held by Apep. She resisted blindly but the lizard dragged her across the parapet. The hostess, Sarah, greeted them at the door believing she was talking to people of like minds.	So this is the sacrifice? she asked, evil intent slathering across her face. Apep elbowed the android in her covered face causing her to stumble and groan.	So the Chitauri are becoming more populous on Earth. Wonderful! One of your kind, Apep, works with us in Cincinnati. Do you know him? Sarah bubbles, snubbing Sam and Misty. Apep shakes a no.	Well, you were invited to bring the sacrifice so lets get on with it. My friends are waiting, she says uncaring of hurt feelings. Sarah leads them through the plentiful guests while pointing to the veiled woman and making obscene gestures. They arrive at a smaller anteroom and are led inside. Two dozen people sit in chairs surrounding a small stage with a sturdy stake jutting up from the center. Apep roughs the android onto the stage and chains her to the stake.	 Sarah stands on the stage next to the doomed figure. Raise your Tecpatl knives and get ready! You each get one thrust so make it a good one! Sarah says exuding lust. The crowd stirs, knives rising and blood lust occupying the eyes of the participants behind their costumed masks.	Ive seen enough! Misty wails. She grabs her plastic projection taser and begins stunning the guests, Sarah first. They crumple in heaps while the android frees itself before exchanging clothing between the Sarahs. Apep takes up station at the one door and begins dismembering any guest that makes for the exit.	Joey says killing is against the rules, shrieks Misty.	Joey says he doesnt kill, Apep corrects. Actually, I have a good reason.	Its in his DNA, Sam says in support. The lizard smiles at her, sort of, blood and pieces dripping from its toothy mouth.	Lets go! Misty commands. The dying guests have sprayed blood on them all. Apep takes the real Sarah, places the veil over her head, and lifts her onto his shoulder. The replacement Sarah feigns unconsciousness and will wake to her new vocation with the others.	Joeys blood-drenched crew moves across the reception room, towards the exit, to the sound of applause.
The epitome of average is Tuesday. It's not Monday, the beginning of the week, not Wednesday in the middle of the weekly drama, just Tuesday. It was summer break and the kitchen counter wasn't even close to being spotless as usual, random items scattered across the surface. But something caught my eye, something that wasn't there before. There was a postcard sitting peacefully on a small patch of clear counter. It was addressed to our house but there was no return address, no message, and no date.The picture portrayed a simple village with a market on a cobblestone road. Above sat a sky so blue it could have rivaled a fresh blueberry.Dad came home from the night shift, staring at his phone while trying to pour coffee. He wasn't doing a very good job though and soon he was heading downstairs to try to scrub the coffee stains out of his clothes. When he finally reappeared I held up the postcard.Have you seen this? I asked, extending my arms. My Dad squinted,It seems familiar but I don't think so, ''he said, pushing his glasses up his nose. It certainly looks like a nice place to live, who sent it?It doesn't say I mumbleSounds like a mystery for you to solve! Dad chuckled.But its summer break! I whine, I don't want to work now!Sometimes it's not always up to us, He replied. I knew he was right, I just didn't want him to be.Listen, I'll make it fun. We can take a special family vacation! He smiles at me. I try my hardest not to groan, I can tell hes trying his hardest. I give a weak smile.Yaaay Ummmm, I read the card Panton, OregonThen Pack a suitcase! He exclaims, we're heading to Panton!I know he wouldnt be doing this if he wasnt trying to make me happy. I suddenly feel better about this trip.Two days later, Were in the car. I watch the cityscape slowly melt into fields and rolling hills. I already miss the busy streets and the noise of San Francisco. I turn on my phone desperately trying to find something to do. I jam in some earbuds and play music until the sun begins to set and I feel like I could sleep for days. Then my phone shut off. I knew it hadn't died, I had been charging it in the carport. The screen seems milky white and black at the same time, something I had never seen before. The power button seemed to have decided it wasn't going to work anymore so I gave up pressing it.That's when I notice the wall. It reached so high it cut through clouds. It surrounded such a large area I couldnt see the ends of it and I had to force myself back in my seat to give up. It was made of a thick metal framing, something that could withstand tornadoes.The car lurched to a stop and no matter how hard dad tried, it wouldnt start again. Two figures appeared out of a hatch in the wall that I hadn't noticed before. They were big burly men in velvet suits, a shade of navy so dark they were almost black.They came up to our car and one of the two pulled down the window with his bare hands.Who are you and what are you doing to my car!? Shouted dad  Ill call 911 I knew he was bluffing, his phone had also gone black and white with the same milkiness dancing across the screen.That wont be necessary The other grumbled in the most monotone voice Id ever heard, We are agents with the US Government. You have been summoned here to partake in Experiment #763 Course #44. Follow us Now knowing how unsafe we were, we had no choice but to climb out of the car and follow them. We stepped cautiously over the threshold of the hatch.The wall must have been really thick because there seemed to be a whole facility inside. As far as I could tell, the busy room stretched throughout the entire inside of the wall. We followed the men past thousands of computers all with people typing away, all wearing the same velvet suits.What could be so important that the government needed us here? I whispered. Dad didn't answer. He was staring straight ahead, barely shuffling along. He was probably in shock, He had been expecting a nice, quiet vacation and now he had to deal with this. I felt bad for him. I was scared too, but not as scared as I was excited. I was practically blocking everything out as the  Mission Impossible  theme ran in circles in my head.We were led to a small room with two chairs. The walls were stark white, the floor the same. A shade so bright it almost glowed. The two men indicated for us to sit. As soon as we touched the chairs bright white cushions erupted from the seat, and I could feel myself sinking. The far wall faded into a black screen and one one the men took a remote from his pocket and pressed a button.The inky darkness instantly came to life and a scene began to form. A harsh red background housed nothing but a simple podium, painted white. An impossibly skinny woman sashayed into view. She gripped the podium with long nails and readjusted her dress which was an orange so bright it was almost fluorescent so it clashed horribly with the backdrop. I tried to ignore her terrible fashion sense as she opened her thin lips and spoke.You have been selected to participate in experiment #763 she pushed the words out of her mouth with such resistance that it seemed like she was forcing them out. The US government is experimenting with technological advancements. What happens if electrical technology is introduced by outsiders rather than discovered. Its your job to pretend you have come to the artificial town of Panton and plant the Idea in residents' heads. She stared into the camera with black beady eyes and almost spat out her instructions. You must be vague. You must be discreet. You must be fast. Any failure to do so, or revealing the truth behind the village will be cause for an automatic total reset.My chair suddenly didn't seem so comfortable, what did that mean? I tried to calm down, assuring myself that wed simply be sent home. I remembered what the men had said, trial 44... Was this the forty-fourth time they had done this?You and your party will assume new identities for three weeks. Your process begins now. At that moment the screen shuts off and the chairs begin to lower back into the floor. I leap up with a yelp and the two burly men are gone. In their place are a man and a woman holding out neatly folded packages wrapped in black tissue paper. We are led to two changing rooms where I tug at the velvet string on the package, it falls open to reveal a sunflower yellow fit n flare style dress as well as a more formal floor-length olive green dress. A pair of brown Mary Jane shoes are slipped through a small doggy door. I quickly dress and notice my suitcase in the corner. I look at my old clothes in my hand and realize its purpose.I step out of the room with the green dress over my arm and notice blue smoke tumbling across the floor. I hear a thud and I spin around. I see my dad's blond flyaway hair dance around as the smoke plays with it. I try to run to him but suddenly my legs feel like lead and I fall to the ground.I woke up in bed. Not my bed, but a bed. I felt stiff, I roll over and find a piece of straw poking up out of an old cotton sheet. At first, Im confused, almost scared. But then all of the events of last night come flooding back. My heels feel like someone rubbed rugs against them for five hours straight. I must have been dragged all the way here. The green dress is laid neatly across the back of a wooden chair.I stare out of an iron-framed window. I knew that Panton was supposed to look older, but I was confused. Sure there were cobblestone streets, but there were also plastic rain gutters. Sure there was no screen in sight but there was a basketball court in a park right at the end of the street. Panton was a hodgepodge of time periods and I didn't know how to make sense of it. I could hear dad snoring through the wall and I laughed to myself. I brush my hair through with a wooden comb I find on a dresser and walk out of the bedroom. That's when I realize I have no idea how to get out of this house.I find a door that looks a little more presentable. I tug at the handle and It swings open. Bright light sweeps my face and I take a deep breath. I scan my surroundings, I pretend I'm a hawk flying over busy streets. But in reality, I'm on a porch, on the ground, in some sleepy town, thats not even a real town.A girl with curly blonde hair runs up to the porch stairs I'm sitting on. She looks about my age, but a lot happier than I am right now.I heard there were new neighbors moving into this house! she squeals Its so odd, the people who live here never seem to stay long. It's almost like theyre on a timer! she giggles as she says it, so much so it's hard to understand her. She has some sort of accent but I can't tell what it is.Yeah almost I avoid her eyes.Listen, she says, her eyes focused on me, a blue light glinting off them, unmoving I'm going to give you a tour, and you are going to love it! Once I can tell shes joking I calm down and follow her. I dont notice how shes wearing a hoop skirt under her ruffled dress and a scrunchie on her wrist at the same time.I learn a lot of things on this tour. Like how it never rains, and how all the food just shows up in boxes in the grocery backroom, and no one knows where it comes from.I stop walking and turn on my heelsWhat's your name?, Im Quinn and I just realized I haven't asked an-Jenna, She says curtly and continues to tell me about the mayor's favorite bowtie collection. As she rambles on about stripes and polka dots and the difference between Red from Cameron Red I study her eyes. They are brown now, how is that possible? I step forward and clear my throat.Well since we're going to live near each other now, what do you do for fun around here? What did you do last week?Well I- Jenna goes stiff, her head turns. Her bubbly attitude seems gone, she just looks terrified. I- I cant remember! It's just blank! I don't know why! Then her eyes freeze forward, and an icy blue frost creeps over them. Soon her eyes are as blue as toilet water. Her voice falls out of her mouth, it sounds cold, there is no feeling in it.Participant #257, you have illegally investigated private matters and have been charged with meddling. If you mention forbidden topics a second time, it will be cause for total Mind Reset No one passing us seemed to have noticed Jenna getting possessed by a government official. In fact, they seem to be looking away. The blue glaze pulls itself away from her eyes and Jenna falls to the ground in a heap, gasping. I want it to end! she sobs It happens every time!Listen, we're going to get through this, I say, pulling her up from the ground. Meet me at my house at 9 am tomorrow. I walk away, my heart beating furiously. If I was a cartoon character, steam would be coming out of my ears. They were erasing their minds, innocent people! This was going too far for an experiment, and I needed to put a stop to it.For the next week, Jenna and I did tests, dancing around the taboo trigger words and helping to restore her brain. Trying to help her remember who she was, and what she liked. I even wrote out everything I knew about Panton on paper, so it can't be considered an offense. As her memory returned and she claimed she felt more like herself, dad was the opposite. He barely got out of bed, his face looked sunken, he didn't bathe, he didn't eat. I had to force him to drink. Townspeople were starting to wonder if I was an orphan. And the villagers, they were a whole matter altogether, sometimes it seemed like they were aware the sky was fake, and sometimes it seemed like they were clueless.After we had lived in Panton for a few weeks, I'm eating some oatmeal at our 60s style diner island that sits under our Victorian mansion-style chandelier. Someone rings the doorbell and I slide off the stool to answer the door. A man with a bushy beard and VERY brightly colored bow tie is standing on the porch and smiling at me. He hands me a highlighter yellow envelope, tips his hat, and leaves. I am a little baffled by the odd encounter but I open the envelope anyway. I read in bold letters; Mayor Rumpfort Invites You To His Bowtie Themed Birthday PartyI silently scold myself for not making the bowtie connection and head back inside. Jenna comes over later to complain that she has nothing new to wear to the mayor's party. I toss her my green dress and explain I'm going to wear one of my dad's suits instead because I'm sick of wearing dresses.That night, Jenna and I walked together to the mayor's castle-penthouse suite. As we walk inside, the first thing I notice is that there are bowties everywhere, there is music playing and cakes laid out across a banquet table. In a corner, I can see my dad bouncing his head to the music.Wow, this is a pretty good party for a fake town I laughedYeah, you're right, Jenna joins in. But then she stops suddenly, and so do I. We exchange glances and for a second, I can't tell who looks more horrified, But then I don't have any more time to wonder, because everyone in the room is staring at us with a blue glaze in their eyes as blue smoke crawls from the vents. And we all hit the floor.I wake up in a chair, it's hard metal, like the dentist's office but 10,000 times worse. Theres rope tying my hands to the arms of the chair. Im confused for a moment, but I realize that if the town is under mind control, there would be no need for proper restraints. I look up and find the most terrifying machine I've ever seen. I can only assume it's to wipe my brain or possibly kill me. To my right, I see Jenna in the same predicament as me.I feel like vomit. Its my fault shes here. I start to cry, and I clench my fists ready to accept my fate,OW! I shout into the giant white room, (By now youd think I would have lowered my expectations for the government's interior decorating skills) I look at my palms and see a few drops of blood rolling down my skin. Then I noticed my jagged chewed fingernails. I knew I'd been nervous lately, but I had no idea it had gotten this bad. I have an Idea.I fold my hands back and rub them back and forth until the ropes are cut through and they break. Then I run to Jenna and untie her. We're free!We run into the hallway and hear voices. We can't get caught, or this situation will find a way to get worse. We slide into a laundry chute and land in a pile of velvet cloth. Jenna starts to pull on a jacket and tilts her head for me to do the same.Soon were creeping through hallways with our new suits when we hear loud noises coming from behind a door. Jenna turns the doorknob to find the entire town population trapped in the tiny room.We silently agree that accidentally on purpose leaving the door open would be a good enough distraction to get us out of here.We are no farther than six feet from the open doorway when we hear a stampede behind us. We slip into the crowd and drop our suits, running in the regular clothes we had on underneath.I notice a water jug and lift it over my shoulder, Jenna notices and hoists it up as well, she follows me to a door with a large plaque that reads Server Room. We dump the contents all over important-looking pieces of equipment and glowing dashboards.We race out of the room as we hear a sizzle. The lights go out, and the front hatch bursts open. Everyone runs outside. Jenna stops me. She looks into my eyes,Thank you, she says For everything Im smiling so hard I feel like my face is going to fall off. And then were off.
"Hello?" John answered his cell phone. "John, listen to me, this is David,"..."David, what's going on little brother?" John asked."John, I don't have time to explain. Listen to me, something is about to happen. You have to get Katie and June out of there, now". John tried to speak, but David talked over him with a stern, seriousness. "You need to get in the car and head, north, to Willow Springs, Colorado. It's a two hour drive from your house. There is not much to the town, but there is a military installation on the west side of town. Find it. There is a bunker. Tell them my name and rank and tell them you have a password for you and your family. The password is  Fallen Angel . Say it, John," David said. " Fallen Ange l. David, this sounds crazy, I can't just"..."John, trust me, brother, you have to leave right now. There is about to be"... The connection was lost. John tried to call the number back but there was no service. John stood at the barbeque grill with the phone in his hand in a state of shock, while four burger patties sizzled on the grill.John's eight year old daughter, June, was in the living room watching cartoons and his wife, Katie was in the kitchen cutting lettuce for the burgers. John walked inside the house and grabbed the remote and turned the television to a news channel. "Daddy! I was watching that!" June protested. "One second sweetie."On the television a news anchorman talked in an excited, and almost panicked voice about falling debris from the sky. The news cut to scenes of New York City, people running, screaming and buildings and cars burning. The debris falling from the sky didn't look like debris at all to John, it looked...orchestrated.Katie walked into the room, "John, what is going on?"Before he could answer, the power went out, shutting off the television and the lights. "We have to go, now," John said.John grabbed June's pink backpack and dumped the books and school supplies out onto the table. He went into the kitchen and started filling the backpack with snacks, canned food, and bottled water. "John, what is going on? Please talk to me," Katie cried. "I got a call from David a few minutes ago. He said that something is happening, and we need to get out of here and we are going to listen to him. I'll explain in the car," John said. Katie carried June and June held tight to a stuffed teddy bear. John carried the backpack and grabbed the kitchen knife that Katie had been using from the counter.Outside, the sky had grown darker as if a storm was upon them. Neighbors were starting to exit their homes and point to the sky. John helped Katie and June into the car and closed the door. He was about to open the driver's side door when a black craft flew low over Johns head at a high rate of speed. John climbed into the SUV and two more crafts flew over, heading east, in the direction of the nearest town.John, what was that? Katie asked. Im scared, Daddy, June cried. He didnt have an answer, he just cranked the vehicle, put it in gear, and stepped on the gas. A few minutes later the family was on the highway and heading north. The sky lit up to east and a in a brilliant white light, followed by a thunderous boom. John stepped on the gas and picked up speed.After a half hour of driving, John slowed the vehicle when he saw a man frantically waving his arms in the air. The mans vehicle was on the shoulder of the road and apparently broke down or out of gas. Should I stop? John asked. Well, we cant just leave himCan we? Katie asked. When they were close, the man threw himself into the path of the SUV and John slammed on the brakes. Stay put, John said as he exited the SUV.Thank you, sir for stopping, Ive been stranded for hours, The man said. Before he could open his mouth and say anything, the man pulled out a revolver and pointed it at John.Im taking the SUV. Tell your family to get out. Now, The man yelled.June screamed and the man looked over at the SUV, and John grabbed the gun and put his weight into the man, and they went to the ground, hard.The two men struggled for the gun and rolled around on the graveled road shoulder. The man ended up on top of John and was trying to point the gun at Johns face. John was pushing back with everything he had. Suddenly, the mans eyes went wide, and he grimaced, and rolled off John. Katie stood in shock with shaking and bloodied hands. The handle of the kitchen knife protruded from the center of the mans back as he lay motionless. John picked up the gun and put his arm around his wife and led her back to the SUV and helped her in back.John was bleeding from a cut on his forehead and scratches and cuts on his arms and elbows. He gave June a pat on the head and a smile and told her it was all going to be okay.Katie didnt say anything for twenty minutes. Do you think hes dead? Did I kill that man? She finally asked.I dont know if hes dead or not. You did what you had to do. You saved me. You saved us, John said.John cursed when he looked at the fuel gauge; it was on one quarter of a tank and they had a ways to go, and the sun was going down.Katie and June seemed to be handling the situation better than John would have expected. They were on the backseat playing a game of rock, paper, scissors, when John saw an exit for a service station. John took the exit ramp and could see the gas station. There were cars backed up for hundreds of feet down the highway, some had been abandoned, he would not be getting any fuel here.John slowly drove past the gas station. There were armed men yelling and pointing their guns at the SUV. Katie covered Junes eyes as John swerved to keep from running over a dead body in the road. One of the armed men began to yell at John to stop and he put his foot on the gas and sped away. A shot rang out and the back glass shattered. Get down! John yelled as another shot fired taking out the right tail-light.John slowed a little to take the ramp back onto the main highway and almost rolled the SUV.He reached speeds up to 100mph on the empty highway until the vehicle ran out of gas.What are we going to do? Katie asked. Let me think John said. He checked his phone, no service. John pounded the steering wheel in frustration. Headlights suddenly filled the SUV and illuminated the inside. Take June over to those pines. Stay hidden and let me talk to them, John said. Katie shook her head grabbed June and ran for the pine trees.The headlights began to close in and John stuffed the revolver in his waistband and stepped out of the car. The headlights were blinding as the truck approached him.The truck pulled right up the John and stopped and the passenger window came down. John was ready to pull the gun but there was a little old lady sitting in the passengers side, smiling at him.Hello, dear. Do you and your family need a lift? Were headed north, The lady said. My family John said. I wouldnt have stopped if it was only you here, son. We saw your family run for the trees, The driver said. My name is Dan, The man said. And Im Carol, The lady said. John called for Katie and June and they made introductions to the older couple and then climbed into the backseat of the truck.Were headed up to Wyoming. We have some family there. How about you folks? Dan asked.Were just going to Willow Springs. We have family there, John lied.Looks like your back glass and tail-light was missing. Did you folks run into trouble? Dan asked.Yes. We took the gas exit a few miles back. There were men with guns. Tried to make us stop and shot at us when I didnt, John said.You did the right thing, son. There is no telling what those maniacs would have done to you and your family. The true monsters come out when there is anarchy like this, Dan said.Do you have any idea what is going on? Katie asked. Dan and Carol shared a look. We dont really know. Something about extra-terrestrials or some mumbo jumbo. We are going to hunker down with our boys and wait it out, Carol said. Not good, Dan said under his breath. John glanced over his shoulder and could see what he was concerned about. Ahead, there was what appeared to be a burning car and headlights. It looked a roadblock of some sort.John, do you have a weapon on you? Dan asked.Uhyes. A revolver, John said. You need to get it ready, because I am not stopping for this death trap ahead, Dan said.Dan stopped the truck and pulled a pistol out and placed it in his lap. Carol pulled up a shotgun that had been at her side the entire time. John reached across Katie and June and pulled the seatbelt over both of them and clicked it into place, and then buckled himself in.Dan stepped on the gas and gunshots started firing from the roadblock. Dan fired his pistol through the windshield at the men firing at them. There was a jolt and a loud thud as Dans truck plowed through the two small cars that were placed to block the traffic. John was pretty sure that Dan ran over one man just past the cars but put the thought out of his mind, as the men were still firing at them. Carol screamed and grabbed the wheel as Dan slumped over. She put her foot over the in the drivers compartment and stopped the vehicle. Carol climbed out of the truck with her shotgun and John got out of the back. He opened the drivers side door and checked on Dan. Dan had gunshot wounds to his chest and neck and he was very dead. Carol! Dan is gone. We have to go, now! John shouted. Carol didnt answer and started walking back toward the road-block and firing the shotgun. A bullet struck her in the torso and John saw her go down. He pulled Dans body out of the truck and jumped into the drivers seat and sped away.John and his family finally made it to the town of Willow Springs. It was a small, dark, and quiet place. John maneuvered the truck to the west side of town and found the small military building with a basic fence and with razor wire at the top. The place appeared to be dead and abandoned. He approached an unmanned gate with a security camera and speaker, not expecting anyone to say anything.John pressed the intercom button and spoke, Hello.State your name, A muffled voice on the speaker said.John Hunt. I have with me, Katie and June Hunt.There was silence for a few moments. Are you the brother to Major David Hunt? Yes, John answered.Do you have the password? The muffled voice said.Fallen Angel. John said as the gate began to slide open.
The boy was a child of the wildness that surrounded him. He was born of the mountains that ringed his lofty alpine valley, formed by the rapids that rushed from their snow capped peaks, rocked to sleep by the winds that howled through the narrow chutes, and awakened by the thunderclaps that echoed off the craggy stone. He was the vigorous, confident wildness that drove the elk from the woods each morning, their antlers glinting in the sun. He was the fresh, gentle wildness of the elderflower and columbine in spring bloom, rendering the valley floor a patchwork of rich hues. He was the unbounded, electric wildness of summer lightning, filling the sky with its fantastical power.The old woman was also a child of the wildness, raised in much the same manner as the boy, in much the same manner as the many that had come before. Hers was no longer the proud, fleeting wildness of youth, but quiet and enduring. She was the ancient stone on the face of the mountain, rough and weathered by the elements, though stronger for it. She was the patience of the aspen grove, a singular living thing made up of the many, indifferent to the shifting of the seasons that blurred into centuries. She was the reliability of the moon, her light waxing and waning in the steady rhythm of things.The town where they lived sat nestled high in the mountains where the air was thin and fresh. It had been there for as long as anyone living could remember, the old woman having the longest memory. She told the story of the towns founding frequently, in reverent whispers, of a time long before herself. The boy would always sit at her feet, crowded amongst the other children, listening to the tale they all knew by heart. They fled the places from below, shed always begin, driven away by the chaotic din, by the struggle, by the loneliness that festered amongst the multitudes.The boy always wondered about the places from below, having not yet made the long, treacherous journey down the winding alpine road that cut its precarious, serpentine path down the mountain. He often daydreamed about the chaotic din, the crowded streets, the buildings that stretched toward the sky, tall as mountains, or so the old woman claimed. He puzzled over its alleged loneliness, wondering how such a thing could exist in a place so full of people.And so, the old woman would continue, they looked toward the jagged horizon, hoping to find a new place, a better place, a wild place.It always struck the boy as odd that any one place should be better than another. Though he had never left the mountain valley, he had, in his brief years, discovered a multitude of places, each as good as the next, at least as far as he was concerned. He thought of the riverbank where the water danced in the sun and the fish glittered just below the surface; of the clearing, deep in the woods, where the grass was soft and the fireflies glowed; of the rocky ledge, high up the face of the mountain, above the trees, where the entire valley fit in the palm of his young hand. He loved these places, and yet, as is natural for those who have never been someplace else, took them for granted.The boy also loved the old womans stories. They were a connection to times and places beyond his own. His favorites were stories of the places below, of the people who lived there and the varied adventures they led. He longed for the day that he could take the journey down the mountain road and begin his own adventures, adventures that might, one day, be worthy of the old womans telling.As the boy grew older, in the final throes of his adolescence, he thought more and more of the places below. He imagined streets that never dimmed, bathed in yellow light even after the sun had fled the sky. He dreamed of crowded places overflowing with faces he had never seen before and would never see again. He longed for a horizon not confined within a ring of jagged peaks, but one that stretched out forever to the very edge of the world. And so the boy stood, overflowing with restless youth, on the precipice of adulthood, wanting nothing more than to jump.Winter descended early upon the valley that year, upon the quiet little town. The boy, by all accounts now a young man, woke to a chill in his bones, frost clinging to the window panes, obscuring the view beyond. He dressed in the gauzy pre-dawn light, slipping silently from his house into a world transformed. A thin blanket of snow had fallen during the night, stealing away the rich gold of autumn. He watched as the sun rose, chasing the shadows across the valley floor, the snow sparkling in celebration of a new day. But even as the sun shone brightly and the town shimmered all around him, the boy felt the whole of the earth had been cast into darkness. For when the snow came, the winding mountain road became impassable, the towns meager connection to the world beyond severed, at least until the spring.That night, the town gathered together, as was tradition, to commemorate the arrival of another winter. For when the snow came, they would converge and listen to the old woman whose tales would tide them over until the thaw. She sat upon the weathered armchair, the one beside the fire, her shoulders hunched against the cold. The children fanned out before her, crossed legged on the floor, their bright eyes cast upward meeting her cloudy gaze, a gaze which saw other places more clearly than the ones before her.The boy was there, standing toward the back of the room with the other townspeople. Even the warm glow of the fire was not enough to thaw the ice that had burrowed into his soul. He looked at the face of the old woman, as he had a thousand times over the course of his young life. She seemed smaller to him now, as if the chair in which she sat might swallow her up. The light from the fire flickered, casting dramatic shadows over the peaks and valleys of her well creased features. She twirled the ring on her finger, the only adornment she ever wore, the sapphire glinting when it caught the light of the flames.When at last she spoke, her voice was soft and low. It was thick with an ancient wisdom that held all present in rapture. For when the snow came, it was the old woman and her stories that restored the towns connection to the outside world. She was their bridge to places beyond and times bygone, her words binding them all together into a singular living thing made up of the many.Her story that night was one she had told countless times before. In fact, the boy felt he could likely recite it line for line himself. It was a story of grit, a story of perseverance, a story of winter. And though it was not a new story, it did lighten some of the burden that weighed heavily on the boys heart, and when he returned home that night, he slept easier knowing the places below were not entirely lost to him.That winter was long and cold, longer and colder than most. The snow seemed to never stop falling as it sought to bury the town completely. The wind whipped through the valley, bitter and insistent. The air was frigid, and the boy thought hed never be warm again. But every night, surely as the moon would rise, its ghostly light bouncing off the snow, the town would trudge to the old womans house to be transported.It was on one such night, deep into that seemingly infinite winter, that the boy crossed the old womans threshold. He stood shivering toward the back of the room, unable to stop his teeth from chattering as the wind screamed in the distance. The room was dim and musty, overflowing with the townspeople who sought the refuge of a tale well crafted.The old woman cleared her throat, and the room sputtered into expectant silence. Her eyes, usually hazy and unfocused, seemed to sparkle in that brief, silent moment before she began, her lips curling into an uncharacteristic smile. There once was a girl, the old woman said, her voice a far-off dream, who lived in this very valley, a child of the wildness that lies just beyond this room.The boy couldnt help but feel disappointed, having hoped the storywould take him someplace else, someplace beyond the valley. Even so, he was surprised, having never heard this particular story before, having thought hed heard all the womans stories by now. He looked around the room, recognizing the flicker of intrigue on the faces of his neighbors.She was lovely, the old woman continued, twirling the sapphire ring on her finger, overflowing with the possibilities of youth, the sun just rising on her time. And though she loved her home high in the mountains, nestled amongst the clouds, she longed for the adventures she knew lay beyond.The boy at once felt a kinship to the girl. He could feel the longing in her heart, could hear the same call of new horizons.At this same time, the old woman said, her voice thick and scratchy, there was a boy, just as lovely, just as young, filled with the same desire for adventure. He lived in a place far away, a great city. It was vast and bright and loud and constantly overflowing with the most interesting people from places distant and exotic.The boy spent his nights in restaurants and taverns and inns, places he knew travelers would be eagerly sharing thrilling tales of their adventures. These stories, told over candlelight in crowded rooms, were his connection to places beyond that city which seemed to grow more confining with each passing day. The boy collected these stories, lived on them, stashing them safely away, deep in his heart, until he could embark on an adventure all his own.It was one night, in a gloomy little inn off a dark alley, deep in the citys very heart, that the boy heard of a place seemingly unlike any other. It was a far-off mountain valley, where the air was thin and fresh. It rested amongst the clouds, so high that the whole of the world stretched out below it. The boy could not shake the place from his mind. It filled him up, consumed him entirely, until he decided he couldnt stay a single day more in his city. And so, he packed up his few possessions and left.The journey was long and arduous and filled with a great many dangers and thrilling tales, but this isnt the boys story, at least not solely. It is also the story of the girl, the child of these very peaks we all know so well.It was a bright day in early spring when she rushed from the wooded fringes that surround us, flying over the valley floor as swift and light as a doe, her hair trailing behind her in a wild tangle. Shed caught word that the town had a visitor, an occurrence so rare she had to lay eyes on him herself. In her haste, she ran square into the boy as she rounded a corner into town, both of them toppling to the ground.When at last they managed to stand, after the girl and boy both stammered out embarrassed apologies, their eyes met and the whole of the world melted away. The girl had never seen someone so splendid, the boy never one so enchanting. She had never seen eyes sparkle so brightly, or hair that shone like gold. To him, her smile seemed warmer than the sun itself, and her laugh as light as the mountain air. They were bound to each other in that moment, for all the moments that followed.She showed him every corner of the town, of her valley in the sky. She brought him to the riverbank where the water danced in the sun and the fish glittered just below the surface; to the clearing, deep in the woods, where the grass was soft and the fireflies glowed; to the rocky ledge, high up the face of the mountain, above the trees, where the entire valley fit in the palms of their young hands.He told her stories as they wandered, his stories, the ones he had collected over the years. She stashed them safely away, deep in her heart, until they became her stories too, ones she would often tell in the decades to come.The spring built to summer, as it always does, and the budding affection between the boy and the girl grew and blossomed into something powerful. But just as spring gives way to summer, so too must summer fade to autumn, and so it was between the boy and the girl. He began to crave new adventures, eager to leave the valley before the snows came in, severing his connection to the vastness of the world beyond. He feared hed grow trapped once more, just as he was in his city from before.The girl, who had so desperately longed to explore the places beyond the valley, felt suddenly tethered to it. After all, she was a child of the wildness that surrounded her and could no more leave it than could the mountains, or the forest, or the river.They clung to each other in the aspen grove during their final days as golden leaves rained down from the branches above. They whispered loving things to one another and made beautiful, naive, youthful promises. But ultimately their ending came, as it must for all things.They embraced each other in their final moments, snow flurries blowing all around them, the crystalline flakes catching in their eyelashes. Tears flowed freely from their eyes, freezing on their ruddy cheeks, flush with cold and emotion. The boy reached into his pocket and pulled out a small ring, one of the few things hed brought from his life from before. The small sapphire sparkled in the sun, much the same way his eyes had done the day they met. He gave it to the girl and made her promise to remember him, always. She promised and accepted the ring, slipping it onto her finger where it would remain for years to come.They kissed one last time, a kiss filled with the sorrow of those not yet accustomed to endings. He turned away and left, slowly shrinking to a speck on the horizon. The snow began to fall in heavy wet flakes. Soon the road would grow impassable, severing her connection to the outside world, severing her connection to him. But that wasnt entirely true, she came to realize, for she had his stories. She had stashed them safely away, deep in her heart, and made them hers.She told those stories often in the years that followed. At first, she told them to feel connected to him, to the boy who touched her soul. Eventually, however, she told them to feel connected to those who listened. She hoped the stories would satiate the calls for adventure for those like her, those who would stay. She hoped theyd inspire those like the boy, those who would someday leave. She grew old with those stories, and as the sun began to set on her time, she thanked the boy who had given them to her, promising to remember him, always.The room was quiet as the old woman finished her tale, a singular tear ran down her wrinkled cheek, glittering in the light of the fire. The townsfolk smiled in the warm afterglow of the story. They thanked the old woman, as they always did, gathered up their children, and headed for home. The boy lingered as his neighbors shuffled out. He paused as he crossed the threshold, looking toward the old woman, a question in his heart that he didnt know how to say aloud. She smiled at him and nodded, it was all the answer he needed. He smiled back at her, content for the first time in years, before stepping out into the cold.That was the last story the old woman would tell, as fate would have it. She slipped away that very night, leaving the valley at last in pursuit of her own adventures. The town discovered her the next day as they flocked to her home seeking another escape. She was perfectly still, her eyes closed, a serene smile etched into her weathered and peaceful face.The town buried the old woman in the aspen grove when the earth was thawed, the leaves just beginning to bud on the tangled branches. The boy was there, filled with the profound sorrow of someone not yet accustomed to endings. He left soon after that, once the road was clear, inspired by the old womans final tale. He was off to the places below, at last in pursuit of his own adventures. He always carried the valley with him, though, for he was a child of its wildness and so could never really leave it. He stashed it safely away, deep in his heart, and wherever he went, he would tell its stories to all who would listen, stories of the place from above.
Amaka, Ben and I have known each other for six years now. The three of us are best of friends. Weve all been to camp meetings halfway around the world; in the national theatre; in the national stadium and in church services all together sitting side by side fifteen percent of the times in no particular order, but the usual order has always been me on either side of Ben who always occupies the middle position between Amaka and me. I mustnt sit next to Amaka if it were possible. We all loved each other but the love between the pair of Amaka and Ben, is bigger than any mind can comprehend. I watched them over the years grow in love and affection; marriage can never pass them by and I would joyfully and most certainly be Bens best man on the day of his wedding.Ben is a jealous lover who is always concerned about who sits next to Amaka, who talks to Amaka, who smiles at Amaka, who gives gifts to Amaka and virtually all the whos and whats that border around Amaka from the outside world. If he wasnt disposed to accompany her to any given event, then no male should, except in matters of utmost necessity of which I am the only male he deems fit. But how did we all get to know each other? How did our paths align?Rolling back in time six and a half years ago, I was a young entrepreneur looking for money to boost my two year old business. It was a small business that made custom bags for ladies, unisex shoes and leather belts for all classes of people. I wanted to acquire the entire building that was leased to me along with all other buildings next to mine and the entire space. The next building to mine was Bens, he used it for the making of fashionable clothes, sweaters, suits and every other thing in-between. Coincidentally, hed been in this business for two years just like me but in a different location. He newly got into this current place of work and we barely knew each other. He was also deeply interested in purchasing the buildings and nearby spaces in order to expand his business. Our common problem was that we personally did not have enough money to buy the entire place. When we realized we both had same goals, we became business enemies. I found myself under intense pressure to raise money and go ahead of him to purchase the entire area, but so was he too. A young lady who was our mutual customer and who would later become the lady of his dreams, a lady with a big heart, fair and lovely to look upon, Amaka by name, stumbled on our path one fateful day and caught us in the middle of a fight. It happened that what was barely an argument in the initial stages, before she arrived, had shifted gears and translated into a fight just in front of our shops. She needed a new pair of shoes and a jumpsuit, but on seeing and learning about what transpired between us, she didnt know and was unable to remember what she came to buy any more. After a few efforts to calm us down yielded no positive results, she got angry and was ready to leave. She appeared to be walking away from us and it suddenly dawned on me that I was about to lose a good customer forever over a foolish fight. I dusted myself up, ran after her and Ben soon joined me after realizing he too was about to lose a very good customer. She noticed we were running after her then she paused, smiled and turned back at us, then she said,You two would make good business partners, you know, seeing that you are both caught up in same industry, you should team up, acquire the entire space and excel to the moon.After she had ended her words, we looked at each other with mixed feelings of relief, then of shame and foolishness. How she became Bens girlfriend till date is a story for another day. How Ben and I became best friends is what you are about to know.It happened that on a certain day I dressed up to attend a seven-day business seminar and workshop in some far away town. On reaching there, I met Ben who was also in attendance. We werent enemies anymore but still not very nice friends, we just wanted to see if things could work out between us in becoming friends and business partners but at such, no much effort had been made by either of us. We were meant to lodge in a particular five star hotel all seven days but our business meeting was abruptly brought to an end on the third day. Prior to my arrival at the hotel, just before entering the town, I heard a voice over the radio of the taxi I boarded say that there had been reports of a prison break and as a result a serial killer and a notorious hacker were declared wanted. As soon as we entered the town we began to lose signal. The transmission was breaking and I could no longer get further information about the news of the prison break so I asked the driver to try other radio stations but after much tries it was clear to us that wed totally lost connections to the radio stations so I resorted to my phone to surf the net but there was no network connection, my phone had lost signal same time we lost the radio stations. This was strange. While we made our way to the hotel, though it was now evening, we could clearly see the commotions in the streets. Was there a sudden increase in crime? If it were so, then it is probably due to the loss in network connection all over this town; there would be no one to call the police if things went wrong. I became concerned about my safety in the town, and to be in a place without network connection even for a night is a nightmare of its own.When I met Ben at the hotel, for the first time in our lives, we talked as very good friends and even ate together. He was the only businessman I knew so well in our business conference at the hotel and so was I to him too. The organizers of the conference and the hotel management assured us that what we were facing was just a minor glitch and the connections would be back in no time. They also told us the hotel was heavily secure and that they ran their own private security system.A day is now gone but there was still no network connection, whatsoever. The problem with this kind of situation is that heavy crimes would be simultaneously perpetrated in several locations and there would be almost nothing the police can do, both the police and the people would be information sick, the latter especially, would be hopelessly helpless. I spoke to Ben about my plans to leave this town but he convinced me to spend one more day and maybe things would get back to normal. He said I should consider how much Ive spent to be in the business seminar and workshop and give the town a chance of an extra day, so I agreed with him. At exactly 3PM of the same day there was a total blackout in the entire town so the hotel resorted to her backup electric generating set in order to maintain electric power for our meeting to continue, but around 7PM same day, all lights in the hotel went out and PANDEMONIUM!!! Yes, there was pandemonium all over the place; all doors were automatically locked except the big door at the main entrance. Suddenly, two men came in through the main entrance and soon afterwards a lot of men in masks joined them. I noticed one of the two men happened to be David the 'One-Eyed-Scorpion', a serial killer that was brought to justice and sent to prison some eight years ago. One of his men said all they wanted was our credit cards and all the money we had on us, but first, since this is a hotel that has lots of food and drinks, we should all party through the night and then by dawn theyll be gone with all they came for, but just then, David interjected with a hysterical laughter and then began to cough, then after some moments of calmness, he said that they were most certainly not going to leave the hotel without a few dead bodies. They kick-started what was a night party for them with loud music but a night of doom for us. David had promised us that by midnight he would pick a random letter of the alphabet and anyone who had this letter as one of his initials would be killed. The killings would proceed on a forty-five minute interval. We were all afraid and terrified, and there wasnt much strength left in me. 12 AM was fast approaching, Ben and I needed to come up with a plan. We still had our credit cards intact which was to be collected after David was done with his killings. Somehow I could remember that before David was arrested eight years ago, he had a killing pattern where his entire victims first names or last names began with the letter D so I started panicking because my name is Dean Harrison. I shared my fears with Ben and he came up with a plan. About thirty minutes before midnight we both approached one of the members of the gang and complained about food poisoning and would need to go to the bathroom but he wouldnt permit us, and then I told him to consider what his boss might do to him if we messed the entire hall with faeces when it was in his power to simply lead us to the bathroom. He gave it a thought and then led us away to the bathroom. Ben was ex-military. He easily overpowered the gang member and we both tied and locked him up in the bathroom. We began to sneak our way around the hotel to look for some glass window to shatter and steal away from the hotel while the party was still on. We did find a glass window leading to the back of the hotel but by the time we shattered it, it was some few seconds after the party was called to an end by David, some few minutes to midnight, so the entire gang heard the noise. We jumped from the second floor of the massive building and landed on some empty stacks of carton. I had more of a nasty crash but felt very little pain due to adrenaline. We ran through the gardens and scaled through the fences. Some members of the gang did try to follow us but lost sight and track of us.We left all our bags and business materials back at the hotel, right in the middle of the town strangely disconnected from the rest of the world, but we made it out alive. Our friendship, like magic, grew stronger and stronger from that day till date. We merged our businesses, bought all the nearby buildings and lands at our place of work. Fast forwarding to this present day exactly six years later, we have a life of which Amaka who ignited the fire that has brought us and merged us together cannot be taken out of the picture. She and Ben would be getting married soon and just like Ive said earlier, their story is for another good day.
Jim stared at his phone. What had Ada been about to say when the connection failed? He dialed her number again and it went straight to voicemail. Jim hung up, then swore and called her again. This time he left a message. Ada, are you ok? Just kinda worried about you, kiddo. Please call me. He paused, then added, Its your Dad. Jim put the phone down and tried to read an old issue of Time. He flipped on the tv just for company. His dinner, a cup of instant ramen and two microwaved hot dogs, lay uneaten on the weathered coffee table. Ada called and Jim said in a rush, Oh honey, thank God! I was so worried. Is there a problem at school? I told you not to take Geometry. Ada said, Dad. Listen to me. Theres not much time and I need to tell you some things. Jim smiled. Was she finally going to come out to him? Hed known for years but it was taking a while for her to figure it all out. Ada said, Dad, remember that camp I went to last summer? Sure, Camp Willow Tree. You loved that place It wasnt an ordinary camp. It was actually a training academy for young special agents. Sometimes they need someone young to infiltrate a drug ring or bust stores selling booze to minors. I was recruited after I graduated high school and have been working for them ever since. Jim laughed. Is that for one of your classes? Drama or something? I didnt know you were taking a class like that! He slapped his pajama clad thigh. That girl of his was hilarious. Dad. Im serious. Please hear what Im saying. I dont have long. Theyre sending a car to pick me up and then I wont be able to talk to you for several months. I shouldnt even be calling you, in case my cell is being tracked. Wait, what? Jim was sitting on the edge of the couch. Where are you going? I cant tell you where Ill be or tell you what Im doing, she said before he could ask. NO! You cant do that! Jim shouted. His heart was racing and his hands shook. Ill be ok, Dad.. My mission wont put me in harms way, or at least not much. Anyway, Dad, I love you and I will talk to you when Im back. Probably three months. But your classes! I withdrew from school last week. Ill re-enroll next semester. This is more important than college. But the car is here and I need to go. Love you to the stars, she said, echoing what hed said when he tucked her in as a child. The phone went dead. Jims mind reeled. His baby girl working for the FBI? That couldnt be right. She was just a kid! He couldnt believe that she could be involved in something so crazy. Three months passed, then four. Jim was almost crazed with worry. He wanted to go find Ada, but he had no idea where to look. As a new semester started, Mondale College called him and asked him to come pick up Adas things from her dorm. He made the two hour drive, hoping against hope that there would be some clue there about where shed gone. Adas room was as neat and orderly as usual, probably no clues here. But he systematically went through everything as he packed it all into the boxes hed brought. He looked in the trash, in the pockets of every coat and pair of pants. He opened coursebooks and shook them. In Fundamental Geometry, a piece of paper floated out. It was a note addressed to him. It said, Dad, if youre seeing this, Ive been gone a long time or Im dead.. I hope its the former. I dont want you to get involved, but I will tell you that Ive gone to the place we always wanted to visit. So shed gone to Mexico, probably Tijuana. He wondered if she had gone undercover and something had gone wrong. Maybe she was mixed up with a Mexican drug trafficking cartel. He tried to swallow over the lump of fear in his throat. He tucked the note into his pocket and drove home. Jim immediately started to pack, throwing socks and shirts into a duffel as fast as he could. He went online and ordered a plane ticket from Wisconsin to Tijuana on a red eye. He had a few hours to kill, so he researched drug trafficking in Mexico on WIkipedia. He found out that most of the foreign drugs coming into the US went through Mexico, including pot, cocaine, and heroin. Powerful drug cartels controlled the flow of drugs from other countries. Almost all of the cocaine in the US is from Columbia and most of that is funnelled through Mexico. Jim was terrified of whatever Ada had gotten mixed up in. Jim barely slept on the flight to Tijuana and was bleary and disoriented when he arrived. Now that he was there he had no idea what to do. It was midday, but he checked into a dilapidated hostel on the edge of town and tried to sleep. When he woke, it was night. Now that he was here he didnt know what to do. Should he show Adas picture randomly throughout the city? It occurred to him that could be dangerous for Ada. He found a slumped, portly man sleeping in the common room and decided to take a stab in the dark. So where would I go to get some cocaine around here? he asked. The man started awake and said, Que? Jim didnt attempt Spanish, and said in English, Cocaine? Need some. He mimed snorting coke. The man looked nonplussed but recovered quickly and his face turned dark. You Americans and your drugs. You're the reason we have so much drug trouble and violent cartels in Tijuana. You want to come here and do your drugs and care nothing for the poverty that is all around you. Then he switched to a more sly tone. But I will help you. For a price, of course. My name is Jose. Jose set off at a surprisingly quick pace and Jims legs stretched to keep up. They went through side street after side street and Jim was quickly sure that he wouldnt be able to get back without Jose, which he suspected was the point. Hed worry about that later. They arrived at a small, white church. Jose knocked on the door and it was opened by a slight man wearing a hat. Si? he said. In rapid Spanish, Jose conversed with the man. They laughed a lot and looked at Jim. Jim crossed his arms and said, Come on guys, are you going to help me or what? They stopped laughing. So you want to buy some coke, the man said as a statement. Yes, I can help you out. Please come in. But first, you must pay your guide. Jim fished some cash out of his wallet. How much? Jose looked at the money. Should be $40 to get here. He paused. And $100 to get back. Jim stared, then shook his head and counted out $40. Thats what you get until I get back to the hostel. Then the $100. Jose looked like he might try to take all of Jims money and run, but he nodded. Ill wait, Mr. American. He sat down on the white washed steps. The slim man gestured to Jim to come inside. A few men sat in pews smoking fat, black cigars. Jim went to shake hands, but the men just looked at him. Uh, I came to get some cocaine, please, he said awkwardly. And some information, actually. If thats ok. He fiddled with a button on his shirt. How much coke you want? asked the tallest man. This was clearly a common occurrence. Jim had no idea. Uh, like the usual amount? The man laughed and spoke in Spanish to the fellows next to him, who were clearly lackeys. The man opened a duffle from under his pew and fished out a ziploc baggie filled with white powder. Here you go, champ. Thats well, how much money you have, thats how much it costs. He laughed nastily. Jim reserved $100 for Jose, then handed over the $200 that was left. Thats everything I have, Jim said. The man laughed. So what is your question? I will answer one thing for you if I can, he said in a conciliatory tone. Im looking for this woman, he said, and held up a photo of Ada on his phone. The men talked together in Spanish, and one of the lackeys disappeared. In a few minutes, a man in a dapper three piece suit came out onto the church stage and stood behind the podium. He said down at Jim, So you are the one asking questions about a girl. Now why would you be inquiring about her? The man rubbed the gun sticking out of his pocket. Jim decided to be honest. Shes my little girl. My only child. We lost her mother a few years back so Im extra protective of her. He straightened his shoulders. I would do anything to find her. Then he lied to protect her cover. I dont know what shes gotten herself mixed up in, but I know her drug problem makes her do crazy things. Look in Zona Norte. Thats where stupid American girls go to sell themselves for drug money. She might be working the street there. Bad, bad neighborhood, you should be careful if you go there. The next morning he took a cab to Zona Norte. He walked around and around, up side streets, down alleys, and past the women offering entertainment of the adult variety. It was clearly frequented by Americans because he was constantly accosted to partake. Suddenly he saw her, his Ada, dressed as a prostitute. She looked haggard and skinny in a tight red dress and heels. He surged forward and grabbed her into a huge hug. Ada squirmed away, saying, Dad, oh my God, how did you find me? You shouldnt be here! But I wondered if you would see my note and try to find me. Im fine, I just couldnt call while I was working for the Sinaloa cartel. Im out of that now, thank God. I think I have enough information to convict a few of the higher level runners. Jim just marveled that he had found her so quickly. The universe wanted them to be together. Ada brought him to a cramped apartment and introduced her partner Ron Guzman, a burly bear of a man with thick black hair. He nodded at Jim by way of acknowledgement. They moved from the tiny vestibule into the living room strewn with papers and maps as well as coffee cups and fast food wrappers. Well, Dad, Ada said, her hand twirling a piece of her hair just as she had as a kid. Now that youre here, you want to come to the border with us tomorrow? I got a tip from one of my informants that a big cocaine shipment from Brazil is on its way here. So well be stopping vehicles randomly and inspecting their cargo. Sometimes they get lucky and sneak through. And sometimes we get the driver, who is just a lackey of the cartels. But we could get lucker and get a squealer. The next morning, he was strapped into a bulletproof vest and driven with Ada to the Mexico-US border crossing. It was slow moving as some of the vehicles were shunted to the side to be inspected. Ada and Guzman scrutinized them, especially the bigger trucks and busses. I see a load of second hand backhoes coming through that I want to take a look at, Ada said. Something doesnt feel right. Guzman looked skeptical but waved the trailer to the side. The driver stayed put, hands on the wheel. Jim tried to stay out of the way as Ada walked around examining the machinery. She hopped nimbly onto the trailer and scrutinized one of the excavators yellow arms. Find me a blow torch, she said while scraping at the paint with the heel of her boot. This is fresh. Guzman shrugged and sent a man off to find one. The man came back and Guzman tossed the torch to Ada, who caught it nimbly. She fiddled with it, then an arc of flame spit out and she squinted at the light. Jim and Guzman watched from below. Ada braced her legs, then used the torch to cut a hole in the machine. She pulled it free with a grunt and looked into the cavity shed opened. She reached in and picked up a package, which she threw down to Guzman. One guess what this is. Guzman used his pocket knife to cut a slit in the package. White powder puffed out and Guzman turned his head. Jim had been leaning over to look and got a face full. Oh shit, Guzman said. His sentiment was echoed by Ada, who was clambering down. Hey buddy, why dont you come down here and talk to us, Guzman shouted up to the driver, who turned and slowly shook his head. You need to get out, now, Guzman said. The man stared straight ahead. You do not want me to come up there and get you, Guzman said. Suddenly the driver turned over the engine and the trailer surged forward. Ada lost her footing and hit the pavement. Jim went over to her. She seemed more stunned than hurt. Feeling a mad rush of energy, JIm was positive that he could stop the truck. He ran like he had never run before and vaulted up onto the trucks running board. The driver looked over at him, wild-eyed and stepped on the gas. Jim was nearly flung off, but held on and in an instant he punched the driver in the face as hard as could through the open window. Howling with anguish, the man stopped the truck with blood gushing out of his nose. Jim opened the door and pulled the man from the truck, dropping to the pavement with him and landing hard. Ada and Guzman were staring open mouthed and responded with cheers and clapping. Guzman cuffed the man and said, now we have another link back to the Sinaloa cartel. Ada hugged Jim tightly. Not exactly the Mexican vacation I had in mind, Dad, she said. Now lets get you somewhere safe to wait out that cocaine high.
Lucy, I'm out extended static didnt find the shack. Gwens voice shook over the phone. 	Did you find anything?	Dont come out [ static ]. 	The call is breaking up. What are youre trying to say? Lucy longed for clearer details. Chills permeated through her.	Fly [ static ] home, dont come here. Stay away, dont waste [ extended static ] contact you in a few days.	Goddamn it, tell me whats going on. The call went silent. Lucy screamed. Mother fucking reception. Her heart pounded. Lucy slammed the phone down. The plastic rectangle bounced on the dirt, landing by a sun-baked shrub. 	The young woman wished she wouldnt have flown out a day after Gwen. She submitted to Gwens request for the later flight so there wouldnt be any connection between their arrivals. Lucy regretted not being with her best friend for their adventures climax. 	The sun trailed directly overhead casting shallow shadows. Lucy considered her limited options. She could remain inside the hotels comfort with a courtesy car to the airport home if she wanted. Dropping the shacks investigation here became a real consideration. Doing so would mean a reprieve from the unrelenting heat, extra time with her son if David was generous and a chance to get ahead with a backlog of work she had neglected.  No risk it, no biscuit. Lucy decided that finishing the quest made the most sense.	The rental sedans cool air offered a comfortable place from the scorching Arizona summer day. Each of her attempted phone calls failed to reach Gwen.  Goddamn large open spaces without cell phone towers , she groaned.  Say what they want about urban life but at least phones work in the city. Lucy secretly savored the beautiful, hilly landscape.  The serene landscape brought people out this way, cell towers be damned. Her quiet mind drew up a fantasy in which she lived a quiet life among the rolling hills. 	The GPS guided her deep into the backcountry. Lucy followed their clues to where the shack should be located. The trip offered her lengthy time for a mental backtrack of their clues. She hoped finding her friend's car would guide her steps to some answers. 	The shack and its sapphire tablet had been long reported to contain instructions on achieving perfect enlightenment. The duos existence resurfaced through multiple articles and footnotes. The precise location hidden behind innuendo. Some believed the structure to be metaphorical. She recalled from memory:  Here lies that which creates the path to peace. A rumor of darkness within light within the darkness. To find what's beyond the shack becomes a quagmire. A shining way to one's truth. Finding the shack offers a landmark, not the goal. Lucys phone buzzed. Gwen. She pressed the green, digital circle. The call echoed within the sedans cabin.	Oh my god, are you ok? The words piled together. 	Hey, I dont know[ static ] much time I have before [ static ]drops. Listen carefully. Tell [ static ]family I love [ static ] wont be coming back. This[ static ]last call to [ static ]. Ive decided [ extended static ] rid of our notes [ static ]about the shack.	Gwen, Im on my way, hang on hun. 	No,[ static ]isnt [ static ]. Please, Lucy, go - The call dropped. 	I need to know that youre ok. Her words trailed off. 	Her foot pressed harder on the accelerator. Lucy longed to see Gwen one last time. She had given up on her son and her family. Lucy promised herself that she would confirm Gwens safety even if it meant her own life. The engine hummed as the young woman neared a dirt road indicated on the faltering GPS. She eased the car off the smooth pavement. Sounds of dirt crunching filled the quiet cabin as the wheels created dust clouds behind. 	Lucy needed the shack as much as she needed to find Gwen. Their lives had become consumed by its mystique for the last several years. Lucy traded away her marriage, childs custody and a coveted promotion opportunity for the enigma. The tablet called to her. Its few online drawings had blossomed her curiosity. 	Lucy had spent her life stumbling from one crisis to another. Family drama. Career drama. Relationship drama. The sapphire tablet offered her the promise of serenity from all external distress. The chat forums indicated how its words would bring peace to the heaviest of souls, leaving only a trail of calm. Lucy longed to walk the trail. She understood how her intensive efforts appeared to others. Some didnt hide their contempt.  All you do is spend your time on this goose chase. Stop being selfish and focus on your family .The conversational memories further clouded her peace. Lucy believed if she came back with the stone jewel, she could prove them wrong and vindicate her efforts. She pressed the accelerator, hoping to cut times corners, passively realizing how speeding on a dirt road became an increased risk. 	Lucy caught sight of a dark, oblong rectangle ahead of her. Gwens car, she guessed. Lucys pulse raced. This would be the moment to find her answers. She used every ounce of willpower to keep from pushing her right foot harder. Her phones reception bars faltered. The Blue Cattle Rental Car bumper sticker confirmed her hypothesis as she pulled in closer. Her car took a space next to the dust-coated rental. 	Lucy shoved the door open. The unbridled heat took her breath away. Sweat adhered to her forehead. She closed the door. One of the few noises besides her footsteps. Lucy considered yelling for her friend. She reconsidereduntil clearly understanding why Gwen didnt want her company. Her steps created light patterns in the sandy soil. 	She followed two sets of footprints down an unmarked trail deeper into the backcountry.  Who else is here? The sun's rays came at her with prejudice. Her green t-shirt began to darken at her armpits as she made the distance between herself and the temporary parking lot diminishing behind her. She longed for cold water. She looked back.  No risk it, no biscuit , she repeated. A personal mantra to calm that deep want to run from the conclusion of their journey.  I need to see her one more time, one more time to make sure . 	Hints of the shacks silhouette developed among a rocky outcropping, blending into the shadows. A smile developed across her drying lips.  This is why no one could find you. Why did Gwen lie to me? Her heart raced. Lucy remembered how most online shack hunters misunderstood several key riddles, leading them to believe their goal resided in New Mexico. Gwen figured out a new interpretation. She had been their clue sleuth since partnering. They kept the success between each other. The shacks presence against its background increased as her footsteps made loose tracks. Lucy fought against her increasing dehydration. A sunbathing rattlesnake watched her with a definitive rattle, warning her away. 	The shack appeared as she imagined. Wide, wooden planks stacked on one another into an angled, planked roof. A dark, custom door in the middle. One window with twin closed shutters. The whole structure hidden within natures stone embrace, protecting it from overhead exposure and much of the elements. Lucy took out her phone. She snapped several pictures fighting against her shaking hands. Lucy activated the exterior illumination. Forty-nine percent battery offered her limited time for her phones external light. She reached for the weathered handle. 	The archaic door eased open, aggravating the rusty hinges which groaned into the open air. Her heart pounded faster with fear and delight.  Will the tablet be on a mantel, will there be clues inside?  Lucy swung her camera light inside, revealing a sparse interior. A dust-covered table. A dust-covered chair. Random cooking materials untouched by time. A wooden floor littered with indigenous rodent tracks. She considered going inside. She looked down. The footsteps she had been following bypassed the entrance. Lucy backed away from the shack undeterred. The door shut with equal groaning. She searched the sandy dirt at her feet. Footstep memories worked their way around the shacks perimeter to the shacks right. She followed them between the wooden exterior and surrounding rocky interior. Its a landmark, not the goal. 	Lucys flashlight tracked the dusty imprints winding deeper inside the stone interior. A petite outcropping offered the outline of a caves entrance. Footsteps led inside. She eased between the rocks, entering into the cave. The path sloped gently downward. Water drips echoed in the near darkness. Lucy noted a sweet-sour smell around her. The phones light became her only guide. Distant, faint noises seized her attention. The ground felt slick under her gym shoes. Echoing sounds grew clearer. Muffled words. A conversation. Lucy strained to understand who accompanied Gwen. She hadnt mentioned meeting with anyone else. Lucy moved cautiously through the cavern, guided by her light, the voices and a need to know more. 	Look, we need to get what we can and get out of here. Gwens words rattled with concern. 	I came for the treasure, I leave with the treasure. A female voice responded filled with insistence.   Treasure? Could they mean the tablet?	If she shows up, this whole thing is blown.	You said she wasnt  going to show up.	No. I said that I told her not to come. This chick is relentless. She sacrificed her job, her kid and her marriage to find this. Shes likely on her way. We need to go before she gets here.	Get me access to the gold and we can split. Then you can make up whatever story you like.	If I had access we would be loading our packs by now.	Or youre stalling for her and then its you two against me.	You know thats not true.	Time is ticking, Gwen. Make your play.	Fine. Her voice dropped in defeat. 	Lucy edged closer. Rock grinding sounds resonated. She moved inwards.  They'll need to pass me to leave. What will I do then? She crept along the worn path. Flickering orange whispers reflected off the stone ahead. Illumination originated from a room after a steep leftward corner. Lucy canceled the phones flashlight. She guided herself closer along the slippery wall. 	"C'mon Gwen, let's do this already."	Do you see me standing around with my thumb up my ass? This takes a minute. Annoyance carried her words. Shuffling sounds grew clearer from the room.	Ok, that should do it. A loud rocky crunching noise startled Lucy.	Thats what Im talking about, the stranger commented with jubilation. Lets load up and roll out.	Lets just carry the chest. It, it will be faster. Gwen offered her idea with confidence.	Yeah, right, are you suddenly going to transform into the Hulk? Do you think we can carry this behemoth? This is why we have backpacks. Think, idiot.Lucy took offense at her partner being insulted. 	Flickering, orange light held residence against the natural wall. Lucy snuck up to the room's entrance corner. Her heart pounded as adrenaline spread through her body. Small metal noises filtered into her ear. Lucy peeked around the corner. Torchlight lit the right side of her face. The room held enough space for the two women, their digging tools and a massive, opened treasure chest near a deep gap in the wall. Gwen and her companion loaded handfuls of gold coins and shining, precious stones into leather backpacks sitting on the wet ground.  Gold? Jewels? This was all about riches? Lucy furrowed her brows. She refreshed her options. Neither satisfied her. Staying meant a direct confrontation. Leaving meant no answers. She considered verbally ambushing them outside the cave. Anger crept up her back into a simmering rage.  That lying bitch. No risk it, no biscuit.	Lucy planted into the entrance, her front filling with flickering light. What the fuck is this, Gwen? Her words boiling with accusation. The two women jumped in surprise, coins spilling from their fingers against the uneven ground. Why the fuck did you tell me to stay back? Anger grew through her body. Her face turned beet red. A snarl crept onto her lips.	Lucy.Gwen stared as if seeing a ghost. The other woman looked on with wide eyes. We found a treasure, something more valuable than the tablet. A saleswomans smile offered a hard sell. Her eyes darted to her companion and back. 	Lucy shifted her attention to the stranger. "Who the fuck are you?" 	Im the reason you found this. Her words rolled with pearls. And there is enough for us all. So start stuffing your pockets and we can talk outside. The woman resumed feeding her bag. 	No, were going to fucking talk now. Lucys fists took form at her sides. This glorious moment she had dreamed of for so long, sullied by an outsider. Her body trembled as adrenaline renewed its surge. 	"Look, bitch, we need to be back on the road before sunset. Otherwise, some local yokel is going to see our headlights and begin poking around. The stranger looked up from her squatted position. As you can clearly see, this is going to take a couple of trips. You found us. Great, now you can have your share. I have no beef with you. I'm sorry if your spiritual chest is actually a gold chest, but we can all make out like bandits if we do this right." She watched Lucy with concern through false bravado.	Lucy, we need to do this now and talk later. Gwen pleaded, her body trembling. 	"Fuck all that, we're talking now." Lucy struggled to keep her thoughts clear. Years of dreaming of this perfect moment evaporated for nothing. This was supposed to be her and Gwens private celebration. Anger evolved into a full-running rage. She became a boiling volcano needing restitution. Logic dropped from her mind.	Lucy charged into the stout room with a deafening scream. Her fists swung like sledgehammers. The woman attempted to defend herself with fatigued arms. Her kneeling position in the room did nothing to help. Lucy struck the woman in the mouth knocking her downward. Blood sprayed. The woman's head hit the jagged ground with a placid thud. A new wound opened into a quickly growing maroon pool reflecting the torchlight. Gwen screamed. Her voice became its own assault on their ears. She never imagined Lucy being capable of such violence. The prone woman's eyes remained open as her last breaths exited. Lucy turned to Gwen. Her friend looked back with shocked terror.	You you fucking killed her. Gwens voice quaked. You killed Allison. 	Lucy aggressively stepped over scattered digging equipment to her friend. Gwen knelt in place overcome with panic, her arms up in defense. Lucy grabbed her by the collar. She forced Gwen backward towards a nearby wall. Gwen tripped over a small rock. The momentum carried her into the unforgiving wall. She collided and fell forward to her knees. Lucy struck Gwen repeatedly through a placid attempt of self-preservation. Her face became a patchwork of bloody bruising. Gwen collapsed onto the stone ground. Lucy stood over her with battered fists. 	Gold and jewels? Labored breath delayed her words. You sold me out for money? 	A crap ton of money. Her breath escaped in jagged spurts. I am so far in debt I cant see straight.	Whos the woman?	"My cousin. She owed me a favor. I needed her help to sell everything." Gwen spat out blood. "I told her that if she helped me pawn off what we found, she could get a cut."	Why? Why did you sell me out?	"I needed to pay my bookies and begin over again. At least you have an ex and a kid to go back to. C'mon Lucy, there's no tablet. There likely never was. We've been chasing shadows until the last couple of months." Gwen wiped her bloody mouth. "We discovered a small note detailing enlightenment among a great treasure. At that point, all I wanted was the treasure." Lucy dropped her arms down to her sides. Hollow shock overtook her body. Wasted trip, wasted life, murder for nothing. 	Gwen found her breath. Lets grab some loot, hide the body and pretend this never happened. No one has found this place in a hundred years and wont for a hundred after were both dead.	Gwen looked up from the ground. Her body and pride hurt too much to move. Lucy walked to the treasure chest. She closed the lid with an audible clunk. Her foot rested against the wooden back. Lucy pushed forward, knocking over the chest. Gold and jewels spilled out over the floor. Light sparkled across the scattered pile. Gwen moaned at the loose riches. 	Take your treasure and your dead cousin. Im done with this. Lucy walked past the mess. She glanced down. A dark blue corner stuck out from the shining pile. Lucys eyes widened. She reached for the curiosity. Both hands pulled out a large sapphire slab.  I found the tablet. I found the tablet. All my problems will go away now. I can finally have peace. Gwen watched with wide eyes. 	Lucy -	Were done. Dont ever talk to me again. Lucy cradled the prize to her chest. She strode to the caves exit.  I can walk the trail of peace. She followed the cave out into the sun-painted day. Her path to the car filled with all the joy she could ever dream of. The sedans engine purred. The air conditioning took away the long walks fatigue. Lucy delighted in her plan to transcribe the etched words for the eternal peace she needed. The car turned off of the dirt road onto a more civilized path. Lucy beamed with happiness. The sapphire tablet maintaining its secrets in the passenger seat. Her long-sought prize to show the world that she was right.
I was unfastening my bra when my phone decided to crawl across my dresser, making alarming noises that I dont recall it ever having made before. Someone was calling me. In 2021. It must be an emergency. Who died? I peered at the screen.  Jeremy.  Well, Jeremy, youve just lost yourself a bunch of points. I turned my music down and answered the call, managing to turn the tail end of my annoyed sigh into a breezier Hiiii. Hello Lou. So you think it looks bad out there? Looks okay from my window. I looked out of my one, which was rattling. Sheets of rain crashing down, trees waving crazily in the howling wind. Yet somehow Id feel more comfortable standing on the roof than being pressured into accepting a telephone call from a guy Id only recently befriended. Going by the rules of pathetic fallacy, this did not bode well for a first date.  I had a notification pop up that a storm is expected around 8pm. The time he chose to meet. In a pub on the seafront a good forty minutes walk away, not on any direct bus route for me. Oh dear, I really do think one ought to disconnect from ones devices from time to time. Wow. Okay, granddad.  Im sorry, but I really do think we should rearrange. I gazed down at my freed nipples, already suspecting Jeremy would never get his hands on one. I could meet you at a pub closer to yours if you like, what do you say? I say: stranger danger. I wasnt comfortable disclosing where exactly I lived, especially with the murderer on the loose whod been making national headlines lately. I really think we should try for another day. I heard peeved grumblings about to bubble up and then the line went completely dead.  Thank you, storm a-brewing . Such sweet vindication. Oh blessed silence. I would have kissed my phone but I hadnt wiped my lipstick off yet. Before I went to scrub it off and change into the fleece giraffe print pyjamas laid out on my pillow like a silently beckoning eunuch, I messaged Nadia. I immediately had to tell my best friend about my disaster of a non-date.  Can you believe it? Who just phones people?! I typed. I was revelling in my outrage now. Thats all that a lot of these dates were good for  amusing ones coupled up friends. I must have caught her in the middle of making dinner or such, as the reply was a rather terse one, saying I needed to get used to making phone calls sooner rather than later.  Yes, and you should stop trying to do two things at once, Nadia.   I watched the dots dance, signalling Nadia still had shots to fire. Youre 28 now arent you? Youre behaving like its an act of terrorism. You should just get used to it.  27, actually. I was determined to keep swinging that pointer on the life dial back from the thirties and towards the mid-twenties. Now my BFF was losing points  not remembering how old I was, what the flip? And I dont need to get used to anything. To thy own self be true, isnt that the phrase? (I knew full well it was).  Only connect, she quoted back (knowing full well how much I hated Forster).  I clearly wasnt going to get the validation I was seeking. I closed the tab on my laptop, silencing Nadia and turning up the getting ready songs playlist. I went to put my phone back on the dresser in its charge up spot, it looking as drained by the turn of events as I was.  I caught sight of myself in the mirror. Id put so much effort into smoothing out the frown lines with the tools I had to hand plus a myriad of lotions and potions, as an ex used to call them, baffled why I needed so many- again, his words. I told him hed get a scare waking up next to me without them. It would be a shame to waste all that hard work. I prodded the crease between my eyebrows and felt the pointer nudge ever closer to the next number up. Which would  not  be 29,  Nadia .  Jeremy had got me thinking about the pub down the road. With its gorgeous open fireplace. Id already sunk a glass of ros. The beats of my good vibes tunes had put a wriggle in my walk. I knew on Tuesdays the Golden Thistle hosted a karaoke night and damned if I wasnt in the mood for a bit of belting. The pyjamas could wait a little longer. You might as well go out, I told my reflection. Then sang the same phrase at it, warming up the pipes.  I convinced it.  														*** I tried to remember which end of the stage had the steps. I was past tipsy now, but not at stage-diving levels of inebriation. The spotlights didnt help. I wondered how the artist whose song Id covered dealt with not being able to see the great crowds that came to see her. Hey! I saw a shovel held out. Squinting, I saw it was actually a hand, attached to an arm, which was attached to a rather beautiful man. Let me help you down, he said.  Fine, I thought. I will play helpless female if it means I get to hang off this hunk. (Yes, women can be creepy too,  Jeremy ). That was awesome, he told me when Id got down to his level. Im in a choir, I waved it off, smiling shyly, as if I wanted to attribute them with all the credit. Then panicked in case it sounded like bragging. Im Stuart.  Louise. Lou was gone. She was an abbreviation of Jeremys fancy, after all.  Stuart was talking. I urged to focus on what words he was using instead of the flashing dimples his utterances created.  Ive never heard anyone cover Elena Morrison at karaoke before. Smooth Big Pill is one of my all time fave albums. His eyes were twinkling with happiness as if he was actually meeting Miss Morrison. Same! It helped me through my first major breakup. I laughed, as though the memory didnt still come back to haunt me at the occasional 4am. Can I buy you a drink? I accepted and while he ordered I was already drafting in my head the message I was going to send Nadia about all of this.  I was glad I decided to weather the storm and go out. I had found someone I could see myself staying in with.
